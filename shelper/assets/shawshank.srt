1
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,499
Mr. Dufresne, describe...

2
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:12,046
...the confrontation you had with
your wife the night she was murdered.

3
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,381
It was very bitter.

4
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:23,057
She said she was glad I knew,
that she hated all the sneaking around.

5
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:28,054
And she said that she wanted
a divorce in Reno.

6
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:31,979
- What was your response?
- I told her I would not grant one.

7
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:35,357
"I'll see you in hell
before I see you in Reno."

8
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:38,906
Those were your words,
according to your neighbors.

9
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:41,567
If they say so.

10
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:44,616
I really don't remember. I was upset.

11
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:47,327
What happened after you argued
with your wife?

12
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:50,243
She packed a bag.

13
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:54,584
She packed a bag to go
and stay with Mr. Quentin.

14
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:59,343
Glenn Quentin, golf pro
at the Snowden Hills Country Club...

15
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:02,672
...whom you had discovered
was your wife's lover.

16
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,182
Did you follow her?

17
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:09,603
I went to a few bars first.

18
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:14,184
Later, I drove to his house
to confront them. They weren't home.

19
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:16,268
I parked in the turnout...

20
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:17,978
...and waited.

21
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,859
<i>DA
With what intention?</i>

22
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,906
I'm not sure.

23
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,492
I was confused...

24
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:25,945
...drunk.

25
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,576
I think...

26
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:30,954
...mostly I wanted to scare them.

27
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:34,496
When they arrived, you went up
to the house and murdered them.

28
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:36,789
No, I was sobering up.

29
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:40,672
I got back in the car
and I drove home to sleep it off.

30
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,845
Along the way, I threw my gun
into the Royal River.

31
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,139
I've been very clear on this point.

32
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:50,348
I get hazy where the cleaning woman
shows up the following morning...

33
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:53,147
...and finds your wife in bed
with her lover...

34
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,474
...riddled with .38-caliber bullets.

35
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:01,030
Does that strike you as a
fantastic coincidence, or is it just me?

36
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:02,940
Yes, it does.

37
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,323
Yet you still maintain
you threw your gun into the river...

38
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,578
...before the murders took place.

39
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,997
That's very convenient.

40
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:12,870
It's the truth.

41
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:17,838
The police dragged that river for
three days, and nary a gun was found...

42
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:22,127
...80 No comparison could be made
between your gun and the bullets...

43
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:25,758
...taken from the bloodstained corpses
of the victims.

44
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,845
And that also...

45
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:32,724
...Is very convenient.
Isn't it, Mr. Dufresne?

46
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:36,147
Since I am innocent of this crime...

47
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:41,024
...I find it decidedly inconvenient
that the gun was never found.

48
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:02,216
Ladies and gentlemen,
you've heard all the evidence.

49
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:06,261
We have the accused at the scene
of the crime. We have footprints.

50
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:09,340
Bullets on the ground
bearing his fingerprints.

51
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:12,517
A broken bourbon bottle,
likewise with fingerprints.

52
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,265
And most of all...

53
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:17,564
...we have a beautiful young woman
and her lover...

54
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,771
...lying dead in each other's arms.

55
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:23,563
They had sinned.

56
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:27,320
But was their crime so great...

57
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,784
...as to merit a death sentence?

58
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,283
While you think about that...

59
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,536
...think about this:

60
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:40,128
A revolver holds six bullets, not eight.

61
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,049
I submit that this was not
a hot-blooded crime of passion.

62
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:47,049
That at least could be understood,
if not condoned.

63
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:48,254
No.

64
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,430
This was revenge...

65
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,264
...of a much more brutal,
cold-blooded nature. Consider this:

66
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,849
Four bullets per victim.

67
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,314
Not six shots fired, but eight.

68
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:03,436
That means that he fired
the gun empty...

69
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:06,443
...and then stopped to reload...

70
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:09,278
...So that he could shoot
each of them again.

71
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:12,077
An extra bullet per lover...

72
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:14,617
...right in the head.

73
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:22,918
You strike me as a particularly icy
and remorseless man, Mr. Dufresne.

74
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,462
It chills my blood just to look at you.

75
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:30,129
By the power vested in me
by the state of Maine...

76
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:34,637
...I hereby order you to serve
two life sentences back-to-back...

77
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:37,515
...one for each of your victims. So be it!

78
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:03,833
Sit.

79
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:11,178
We see you've served
20 years of a life sentence?

80
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,349
- Yes, Sir.
- You feel you've been rehabilitated?

81
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:18,344
Oh, yes, sir. Absolutely, sir.

82
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:21,472
I mean, I learned my lesson.

83
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:25,984
I can honestly say
that I'm a changed man.

84
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,566
I'm no longer a danger to society.

85
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,742
That's God's honest truth.

86
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:12,861
Hey, Red. How'd it go?

87
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:15,238
Same old shit, different day.

88
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,361
Yeah, I know how you feel.

89
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,571
I'm up for rejection next week.

90
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,870
Yeah, I got rejected last week.

91
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,372
It happens.

92
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:25,998
Hey, Red, bump me a deck.

93
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:29,502
Get out of my face, man!
You're into me for five packs already.

94
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:30,708
- Four!
- Five!

95
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:35,258
There must be a con like me
in every prison in America.

96
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:37,259
I'm the guy who can get it for you.

97
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:40,593
Cigarettes, a bag of reefer,
if that's your thing...

98
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:44,229
...a bottle of brandy to celebrate
your kid's high school graduation.

99
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:46,557
Damn near anything within reason.

100
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:50,485
<i>Yes, sir. I'm a regular Sears and Roebuck.</i>

101
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,363
So when Andy Dufresne
came to me in 1949...

102
00:08:56,578 --> 00:09:00,116
...and asked me to smuggle
Rita Hayworth into the prison for him...

103
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:02,618
...1 told him, "No problem."

104
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:26,309
Officers
to main gate. Officers to main gate.

105
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:29,520
Secure main gate.

106
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:46,666
Andy came to Shawshank Prison...

107
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:50,746
...in early 1947 for murdering his wife
and the fella she was banging.

108
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:55,176
On the outside, he'd been vice president
of a large Portland bank.

109
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,381
Good work for a man so young.

110
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,263
Hey, Red.

111
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,381
You speak English, butt-steak?

112
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,466
You follow this officer.

113
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,484
I never seen such a sorry-looking
heap of maggot shit in all my life.

114
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:04,327
Hey, fish! Come over here!

115
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:28,969
Taking bets today, Red?

116
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,062
Smokes or coin? Bettor's choice.

117
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:32,935
Smokes. Put me down for two.

118
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,066
All right, who's your horse?

119
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,019
That little sack of shit.

120
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:41,611
- Eighth. Eighth from the front. He'll be first.
- Oh, bullshit! I'll take that action.

121
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:44,321
- Yeah, me too.
- You're out some smokes, son.

122
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:46,281
If you're so smart, you call it.

123
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:49,580
I'll take the chubby fat-ass there.

124
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:52,375
The fifth one.
Put me down for a quarter deck.

125
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,336
Fresh Fish!

126
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,297
Fresh fish today!

127
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,507
We're reeling them in!

128
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:03,842
I admit I didn't think much of Andy
first time I laid eyes on him.

129
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,303
Looked like a stiff breeze
would blow him over.

130
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,760
That was my first impression of the man.

131
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,390
What do you say?

132
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:14,894
That tall drink of water
with the silver spoon up his ass.

133
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:17,225
That guy? Never happen.

134
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,686
- Ten cigarettes.
- That's a rich bet.

135
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:21,988
Who's going to prove me wrong?

136
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,990
Heywood? Jigger?

137
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:25,571
Skeets?

138
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:27,118
Floyd!

139
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:30,121
Four brave souls.

140
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:33,075
Return to your cellblocks for evening count.

141
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:36,582
All prisoners, return to your cellblocks.

142
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:59,602
Turn to the right! Eyes front.

143
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:15,292
This is Mr. Hadley.
He's captain of the guards.

144
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,585
I'm Mr. Norton, the warden.

145
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,004
You are convicted felons.

146
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,291
That's why they've sent you to me.

147
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,250
Rule number one:

148
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,960
No blasphemy.

149
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:29,885
I'll not have the Lord's name
taken in vain in my prison.

150
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:31,307
The other rules...

151
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,807
...you'll figure out as you go along.
Any questions?

152
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,224
When do we eat?

153
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,944
You eat when we say you eat.

154
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,403
You shit when we say you shit,
and piss when we say you piss.

155
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:53,454
You got that,
you maggot-dick motherfucker?

156
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:56,700
On your feet.

157
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,660
I believe in two things:

158
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,338
Discipline and the Bible.

159
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,923
Here, you'll receive both.

160
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,839
Put your trust in the Lord.

161
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,671
Your ass belongs to me.

162
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,428
Welcome to Shawshank.

163
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:19,939
Unhook them.

164
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:26,776
Turn around.

165
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:35,034
That's enough.

166
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,949
Move to the end of the cage.

167
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:41,453
Turn around. Delouse him.

168
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:44,873
Turn around.

169
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,428
Move out of the cage.
Pick up your clothes and Bible.

170
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,971
Next man up!

171
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:56,976
To the right. Right. Right. Right.

172
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:58,762
Left. Left.

173
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:02,982
The first night's the toughest.
No doubt about it.

174
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:06,521
They march you in
naked as the day you were born...

175
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:10,528
...Skin burning and half-blind
from that delousing shit.

176
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:13,614
And when they put you in that cell...

177
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:16,162
...and those bars slam home...

178
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,831
...that's when you know it's for real.

179
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,418
Old life blown away
in the blink of an eye.

180
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:27,007
Nothing left but all the time
in the world to think about it.

181
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:31,507
Most new fish come close to madness
the first night.

182
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:34,761
Somebody always breaks down crying.

183
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:36,929
Happens every time.

184
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:39,640
The only question is...

185
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:41,597
...who's it going to be?

186
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:45,938
It's as good a thing
to bet on as any, I guess.

187
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:49,691
I had my money on Andy Dufresne.

188
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,369
Lights out!

189
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:23,229
I remember my first night.

190
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,979
Seems like a long time ago.

191
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,821
Hey, fish.

192
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,487
Fish, fish, fish, fish, fishy.

193
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,986
What are you, scared of the dark?

194
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:43,041
Bet you wish your daddy
never dicked your mama!

195
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:47,621
Piggy! Pork! I want me a pork chop. Oh, yes!

196
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:53,593
Poke your ass out, give me a first look!

197
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:54,844
Shh! Keep it down.

198
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:58,257
The boys always go fishing
with first-timers.

199
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:01,514
And they don't quit
till they reel someone in.

200
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:04,521
Hey, Fat Ass.

201
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,356
Fat Ass!

202
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,269
Talk to me, boy.

203
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,647
I know you're there.
I can hear you breathing.

204
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,824
Don't you listen to these nitwits,
you hear me?

205
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,947
This place ain't so bad.

206
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:20,612
Tell you what...

207
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,957
...I'll introduce you around,
make you feel right at home.

208
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:28,537
I know a couple of
big old bull queers that'd just...

209
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:30,709
...love to make your acquaintance.

210
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:34,418
Especially that big, white,
mushy butt of yours.

211
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:35,718
God!

212
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:37,800
I don't belong here!

213
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:40,807
- We have a winner!
- I want to go home!

214
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:43,764
And it's Fat Ass by a nose!

215
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:50,275
Fresh fish! Fresh fish! Fresh fish!

216
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,652
I don't belong here.

217
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,239
I want to go home!

218
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,441
I want my mother!

219
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:00,910
I had your mother!
She wasn't that great!

220
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:00,993
I had your mother!
She wasn't that great!

221
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,242
What the Christ is this horseshit?

222
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,543
He blasphemed. I'll tell the warden.

223
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:13,168
- You'll tell him with my baton up your ass!
- You gotta let me out!

224
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:16,797
What is your malfunction,
you fat barrel of monkey spunk?

225
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:20,005
Please! I ain't supposed to be here.

226
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:21,551
Not me!

227
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,099
I won't count to three. Not even to one.

228
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:26,349
You will shut up,
or I'll sing you a lullaby!

229
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:29,564
- Shut up, man. Shut up!
- There's been a mistake.

230
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:32,980
You don't understand.
I'm not supposed to be here.

231
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,481
Open that cell.

232
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:37,940
Me neither! They run this place
like a fucking prison!

233
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,452
Son of a bitch!

234
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,713
Captain, take it easy!

235
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:20,361
If I hear so much as a mouse fart
in here tonight...

236
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:23,989
...I swear by God and Jesus,
you will all visit the infirmary.

237
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:26,829
Every last motherfucker in here.

238
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:33,916
Call the trustees. Take that
tub of shit down to the infirmary.

239
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:52,889
His first night in the joint,
Dufresne cost me two packs of cigarettes.

240
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:56,101
He never made a sound.

241
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,701
Tier 3 north, clear count!

242
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,746
- Tier 2 north, clear.
- Tier 2 south, clear.

243
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,999
- Tier 3 south, clear.
- Tier 1 north, clear.

244
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:23,636
- Tier 1 south, clear.
- Tier 4 south, clear.

245
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,805
Prepare to roll out.

246
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:30,885
Roll out!

247
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,987
Are you going to eat that?

248
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,907
I hadn't planned on it.

249
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:32,204
Do you mind?

250
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,211
That's nice and ripe.

251
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:56,020
Jake says thank you.

252
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:59,687
Fell out of his nest
over by the plate shop.

253
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:04,479
I'm going to look after him
until he's big enough to fly.

254
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,406
Oh, no, no! Here he comes.

255
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,202
Morning, fellas.

256
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:14,371
Fine morning, isn't it?

257
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,915
You know why it's a fine morning,
don't you?

258
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:19,418
Come on, send them down.
I want them all lined up...

259
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:22,250
...just like a pretty little
chorus line.

260
00:22:23,384 --> 00:22:24,590
Yeah, look at that.

261
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:28,257
- I can't stand this guy.
- Oh, Lord!

262
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:31,423
Yes! Richmond, Virginia.

263
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,965
Smell my ass!

264
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,846
After he smells mine.

265
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:39,309
Gee, Red, that's a shame about your horse
coming in last and all.

266
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:42,358
But I sure do love
that winning horse of mine, though.

267
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:45,562
I believe I owe that boy a great big
sloppy kiss when I see him.

268
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:49,949
Why don't you give him some of your
cigarettes instead? Lucky fuck!

269
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:51,780
Hey, Tyrell.

270
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:54,112
You pull infirmary duty this week?

271
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,664
How's that horse of mine doing anyway?

272
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:58,199
Dead.

273
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,251
Hadley busted his head up pretty good.

274
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:03,625
Doc had gone home for the night.

275
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:06,420
Poor bastard lay there
till this morning.

276
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:09,093
By then, there wasn't nothing
we could do.

277
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:16,680
What was his name?

278
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,305
What'd you say?

279
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,647
I was just wondering
if anyone knew his name.

280
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:29,064
What the fuck do you care, new fish?

281
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:33,193
Doesn't fucking matter
what his name was. He's dead.

282
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,297
Hey.

283
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,258
Anybody come at you yet?

284
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:01,228
Anybody get to you yet?

285
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,437
Hey, we all need friends in here.

286
00:24:05,736 --> 00:24:07,397
I could be a friend to you.

287
00:24:10,658 --> 00:24:12,114
Hey.

288
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:18,033
Hard to get.

289
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,615
I like that.

290
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,793
Andy kept pretty much
to himself at first.

291
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,094
I guess he had a lot on his mind...

292
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:37,389
...trying to adapt
to life on the inside.

293
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:41,311
Wasn't until a month went by
that he finally opened his mouth...

294
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:43,889
...to say more than two words
to somebody.

295
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:46,649
As it turned out...

296
00:24:47,111 --> 00:24:48,977
...that somebody was me.

297
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:55,775
<i>Officers Russell
and Berwell, report to duty officer.</i>

298
00:24:55,953 --> 00:24:57,569
Russell and Berwell, report to...

299
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,532
I'm Andy Dufresne.

300
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:02,490
Wife-killing banker.

301
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,084
Why'd you do it?

302
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,587
I didn't, since you ask.

303
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:11,006
You're going to fit right in.

304
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,922
Everybody in here's innocent.
Didn't you know that?

305
00:25:14,555 --> 00:25:17,764
- What you in here for?
- Didn't do it. Lawyer fucked me.

306
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:23,352
Rumor has it you're a real cold fish.

307
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:27,148
You think your shit smells
sweeter than most. Is that right?

308
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,815
What do you think?

309
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:32,277
To tell you the truth,
I haven't made up my mind.

310
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:36,195
I understand you're a man
that knows how to get things.

311
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:40,449
I'm known to locate certain things
from time to time.

312
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:42,621
I wonder if you might get me
a rock hammer.

313
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:45,249
- A what?
- A rock hammer.

314
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:48,289
- What is it and why?
- What do you care?

315
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:52,339
Well, if it was a toothbrush, I wouldn't ask.
I'd quote a price.

316
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,963
But then a toothbrush
is a non-lethal object, isn't it?

317
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:57,966
Fair enough.

318
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:01,007
A rock hammer is about
six or seven inches long.

319
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,558
- Looks like a miniature pickax.
- Pickax?

320
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:05,978
- For rocks.
- Rocks.

321
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:08,806
Quartz?

322
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:11,400
Quartz.

323
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:16,197
And some mica, shale...

324
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:18,691
...limestone.

325
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,067
So?

326
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,828
So I'm a rock hound.

327
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:26,373
At least I was in my old life.
I'd like to be again on a limited basis.

328
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:29,751
Or maybe you'd like to sink your toy
into somebody's skull.

329
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:32,835
No, sir. No, I have no enemies here.

330
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:35,340
No? Wait a while.

331
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,552
Word gets around.

332
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:41,715
The Sisters have taken
quite a liking to you.

333
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:44,888
Especially Bogs.

334
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:49,355
Don't suppose it would help any
if I explained to them I'm not homosexual.

335
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:50,981
Neither are they.

336
00:26:51,193 --> 00:26:54,652
You have to be human first.
They don't qualify.

337
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:03,528
Bull queers take by force.
That's all they want or understand.

338
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:07,285
If I were you, I'd grow eyes
in the back of my head.

339
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:10,243
- Thanks for the advice.
- Well, that's free.

340
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:12,544
You understand my concern.

341
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:16,090
If there's any trouble,
I won't use the rock hammer, okay?

342
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:20,345
Then I'd guess you want to escape.
Tunnel under the wall, maybe.

343
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:22,884
Did I miss something? What's so funny?

344
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:26,016
You'll understand
when you see the rock hammer.

345
00:27:27,855 --> 00:27:30,062
What's an item like this usually go for?

346
00:27:30,274 --> 00:27:32,766
Seven dollars in any rock-and-gem shop.

347
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:35,735
My normal markup's 20 percent.

348
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:38,313
But this is a specialty item.

349
00:27:38,532 --> 00:27:42,992
Risk goes up, price goes up.
Let's make it an even 10 bucks.

350
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:44,534
Ten it is.

351
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:48,285
Waste of money, if you ask me.

352
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:49,870
Why's that?

353
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:54,291
Folks around this joint
love surprise inspections.

354
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,881
They find it, you're going to lose it.

355
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:00,175
If they do catch you with it,
you don't know me.

356
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:02,594
You mention my name,
we never do business again.

357
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:06,216
Not for shoelaces or a stick of gum.
Now you got that?

358
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,596
I understand.

359
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:11,929
Thank you, Mr...

360
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:13,142
Red.

361
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:15,187
- Name's Red.
- Red.

362
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:18,273
Why do they call you that?

363
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:24,025
Maybe it's because I'm Irish.

364
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:35,078
I could see why some of the boys
took him for snobby.

365
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:38,376
He had a quiet way about him...

366
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:42,881
...a walk and a talk that just
wasn't normal around here.

367
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:44,678
He strolled...

368
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:49,100
...like a man in the park without a care
or a worry in the world.

369
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:53,976
Like he had on an invisible coat
that would shield him from this place.

370
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:58,150
Yeah, I think it would be fair to say...

371
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,644
...I liked Andy from the start.

372
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:05,991
Let's go! Some of us
got a schedule to keep.

373
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:11,823
Move it! Come on, move it!

374
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:17,332
How you doing?
How's the wife treating you?

375
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,974
Keep it moving.

376
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:36,014
Red.

377
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:56,958
Andy was right.

378
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:59,419
I finally got the joke.

379
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:02,127
It would take a man about 600 years...

380
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:04,800
...to tunnel under the wall
with one of these.

381
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:11,015
- Book?
- Not today.

382
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:19,056
- Book?
- No.

383
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:22,939
Hey, Brooksie.

384
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:27,569
Delivery for Dufresne.

385
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:36,740
- Book?
- Pass.

386
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:39,868
Book?

387
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:46,839
Dufresne, here's your book.

388
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,090
Thanks.

389
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:03,067
Dufresne, we're running low on hexite.
Get on back and fetch us up some.

390
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:41,939
This will blind you.

391
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:44,684
Honey, hush.

392
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:59,206
That's it. You fight!

393
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:00,874
Better that way.

394
00:32:09,136 --> 00:32:12,219
I wish I could tell you
that Andy fought the good fight...

395
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:14,422
...and the Sisters let him be.

396
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:16,848
I wish I could tell you that...

397
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:20,010
...but prison is no fairy-tale world.

398
00:32:21,148 --> 00:32:23,105
He never said who did it.

399
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:24,940
But we all knew.

400
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:32,273
Things went on like that for a while.

401
00:32:32,701 --> 00:32:35,193
Prison life consists of routine...

402
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:37,411
...and then more routine.

403
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:43,454
Every so often, Andy would show up
with fresh bruises.

404
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:46,753
The Sisters kept at him.

405
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:49,044
Sometimes he was able
to fight them off.

406
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:50,749
Sometimes not.

407
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:54,090
And that's how it went for Andy.

408
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,422
That was his routine.

409
00:32:57,267 --> 00:33:00,726
I do believe those first two years
were the worst for him.

410
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:04,563
And I also believe
if things had gone on that way...

411
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,358
...this place would have
got the best of him.

412
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:10,899
But then, in the spring of 1949...

413
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:13,025
...the powers that be decided that:

414
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:16,575
The roof of the license-plate factory
needs resurfacing.

415
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:19,954
I need a dozen volunteers
for a week's work.

416
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,121
As you know...

417
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:26,414
...special detail carries with it
special privileges.

418
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:29,042
It was outdoor detail...

419
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:33,713
...and May is one damned fine month
to be working outdoors.

420
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:35,260
Stay in line there.

421
00:33:35,472 --> 00:33:38,635
More than 100 men
volunteered for the job.

422
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:45,930
"Wallace E. Unger.

423
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:48,773
Ellis Redding."

424
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,567
Wouldn't you know it?

425
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:54,275
Me and some fellows I know
were among the names called.

426
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:56,482
"Andrew Dufresne."

427
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:59,823
It only cost us
a pack of smokes per man.

428
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:02,788
I made my usual 20 percent, of course.

429
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:06,458
So this big-shot lawyer
calls me long-distance from Texas.

430
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:08,252
I say, "Yeah?"

431
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:12,123
He says, "Sorry to inform you,
but your brother just died."

432
00:34:12,342 --> 00:34:16,256
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- I'm not. He was an asshole.

433
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:18,633
Ran off years ago.
Figured him for dead.

434
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:21,135
So anyway, this lawyer fellow says to me:

435
00:34:21,351 --> 00:34:25,470
"Your brother died a rich man."
Oil wells and shit. Close to a million bucks.

436
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:28,013
- A million bucks?
- Yeah.

437
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:32,810
- Incredible how lucky some assholes get.
- You going to see any of that?

438
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:36,188
Thirty-five thousand.
That's what he left me.

439
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:38,149
- Dollars?
- Yep.

440
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:41,318
Holy shit, that's great!
That's like winning the sweepstakes.

441
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:42,824
Isn't it?

442
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:45,956
Dumb-shit, what do you think
the government is gonna do to me?

443
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:48,499
Take a big wet bite
out of my ass is what.

444
00:34:49,296 --> 00:34:50,627
Poor Byron.

445
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:54,669
Terrible fucking luck, huh?
Crying shame.

446
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:57,171
Some people really got it awful.

447
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:58,794
Andy, are you nuts?

448
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:00,880
Keep your eyes on your mop, man! Andy.

449
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:04,057
You'll pay some tax,
but you'll still end up--

450
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:07,057
<i>Yeah, yeah, maybe enough 10 buy
anew car, and then what?</i>

451
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:09,434
I got to pay tax on the car. Repair...

452
00:35:09,691 --> 00:35:13,400
...maintenance, kids pestering you
to take them for a ride all the time.

453
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:17,317
Then if you figure your tax wrong,
you pay out of your own pocket.

454
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,648
I tell you! Uncle Sam!

455
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:23,281
He puts his hand in your shirt
and squeezes your tit till it's purple.

456
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:25,037
Andy. Andy. Andy.

457
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:28,703
- Getting himself killed.
- Keep tarring.

458
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:31,455
Some brother. Shit!

459
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:32,998
Hey!

460
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:37,795
Mr. Hadley...

461
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:40,043
...do you trust your wife?

462
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:43,137
Oh, that's funny.

463
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:46,345
You'll look funnier
sucking my dick with no teeth.

464
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:49,853
What I mean is, do you think
she'd go behind your back?

465
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:54,395
Step aside, Mert. This fucker's
having himself an accident.

466
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:55,684
He'll push him off!

467
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:57,728
Because if you trust her, you can keep...

468
00:35:57,906 --> 00:35:59,317
...that 35,000.

469
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:02,112
- What did you say?
- Thirty-five thousand.

470
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:04,117
- Thirty-five thousand.
- All of it.

471
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:05,618
- All of it?
- Every penny.

472
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:07,700
You better start making sense.

473
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:10,248
If you want to keep it,
give it to your wife.

474
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:14,332
The IRS allows a one-time-only gift
to your spouse for up to $60,000.

475
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:16,914
- Bullshit. Tax-free?
- Tax-free.

476
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:19,083
IRS can't touch one cent.

477
00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:21,927
You're that smart banker
what killed his wife, aren't you?

478
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:25,548
Why should I believe a smart banker?
So I can end up in here with you?

479
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:28,600
It's perfectly legal. Go ask the IRS.
They'll say the same thing.

480
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:32,855
Actually, I feel stupid telling you this.
I'm sure you would have investigated.

481
00:36:33,066 --> 00:36:36,730
I don't need you to tell me
where the bear shit in the buckwheat.

482
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:40,313
Of course not. But you do need
someone to set up the tax-free gift for you.

483
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:42,114
That'll cost you.
A lawyer, for example.

484
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:44,570
A bunch of ball-washing bastards!

485
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:48,495
I suppose I could set it up for you.
That would save you some money.

486
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:50,789
You get the forms,
I'll prepare them for you...

487
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,741
...nearly free of charge.

488
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:57,296
I'd only ask three beers apiece
for each of my coworkers.

489
00:36:58,258 --> 00:37:00,625
"Coworkers." That's rich, ain't it?

490
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:03,134
I think a man working outdoors
feels more like a man...

491
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:06,805
...if he can have a bottle of suds.
That's only my opinion...

492
00:37:07,267 --> 00:37:08,257
...Sir.

493
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:14,145
What are you jimmies staring at?

494
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:15,931
Let's go! Work!

495
00:37:25,452 --> 00:37:27,363
And that's how it came to pass...

496
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:30,241
...that on the second-to-last
day of the job...

497
00:37:30,457 --> 00:37:34,997
...the convict crew that tarred
the factory roof in the spring of '49...

498
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:38,329
...wound up sitting in a row
at 10:00 in the morning...

499
00:37:38,548 --> 00:37:44,009
...drinking icy-cold beer,
courtesy of the hardest screw...

500
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:47,508
...that ever walked a turn
at Shawshank State Prison.

501
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:50,140
Drink up while it's cold, ladies.

502
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:55,812
The colossal prick even managed
to sound magnanimous.

503
00:37:56,941 --> 00:38:01,401
We sat and drank with the sun
on our shoulders and felt like free men.

504
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:05,193
Hell, we could have been tarring
the roof of one of our own houses.

505
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:08,241
We were the lords of all creation.

506
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:10,410
As for Andy...

507
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:13,280
...he spent that break
hunkered in the shade...

508
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,992
...a strange little smile on his face...

509
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:18,418
...watching us drink his beer.

510
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:27,886
Hey. Want a cold one, Andy?

511
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:31,514
No, thanks. I gave up drinking.

512
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,563
You could argue he'd done it
to curry a favor with the guards.

513
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:43,068
Or maybe make a few friends
among us cons.

514
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:44,861
Me?

515
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:47,861
I think he did it
just to feel normal again...

516
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:50,525
...if only for a short while.

517
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:54,245
King me.

518
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:58,742
- Chess. Now there's a game of kings.
- What?

519
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:00,703
Civilized. Strategic.

520
00:39:01,381 --> 00:39:04,373
And a total fucking mystery. I hate it.

521
00:39:04,634 --> 00:39:06,420
Let me teach you someday.

522
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:08,919
Sure.

523
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:11,137
We could get a board together.

524
00:39:11,391 --> 00:39:14,429
You're talking to the right man.
I can get things, right?

525
00:39:14,644 --> 00:39:18,638
We might do business on a board,
and I'll carve the pieces myself.

526
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:22,145
One side in alabaster, the opposing side
in soapstone. What do you think?

527
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:24,142
I think it'll take years.

528
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,899
Years I got.
What I don't have are the rocks.

529
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:29,072
Pickings are pretty slim in the yard.

530
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:31,116
Pebbles, mostly.

531
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:38,244
Andy, we're getting to be
kind of friends, aren't we?

532
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:40,663
Yeah, I guess.

533
00:39:41,296 --> 00:39:42,832
Can I ask you something?

534
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:45,755
Why'd you do it?

535
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:48,550
I'm innocent, Red.

536
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:50,798
Just like everybody else here.

537
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:56,679
What are you in for?

538
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,559
Murder. Same as you.

539
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:02,935
Innocent?

540
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:08,020
Only guilty man in Shawshank.

541
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:22,918
Perimeter check. North wall.

542
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:08,872
Where's the canary?

543
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:10,381
How did you know?

544
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:12,883
- How did I know what?
- So you don't know.

545
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:14,215
Come.

546
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:18,840
This is where the canary is, Johnny.

547
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:24,855
Quite a surprise to hear
a woman singing in my house, eh?

548
00:41:28,361 --> 00:41:29,726
That's quite a...

549
00:41:30,697 --> 00:41:32,358
...surprise.

550
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:38,076
- Red?
- Wait, wait.

551
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,069
Here she comes.

552
00:41:40,373 --> 00:41:43,240
This is the part I really like,
when she does that shit with her hair.

553
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:46,160
Oh, yeah, I know. I've seen it
three times this month.

554
00:41:46,379 --> 00:41:48,245
Gilda, are you decent?

555
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:50,418
Me?

556
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:52,920
- Oh!
- Oh.

557
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:54,880
God, I love it.

558
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:03,051
I understand you're a man
that knows how to get things.

559
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:07,772
Yeah, I'm known to locate certain things
from time to time. What do you want?

560
00:42:07,984 --> 00:42:10,100
- Rita Hayworth.
- What?

561
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:12,060
Can you get her?

562
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:16,816
So this is Johnny Farrel.
I've heard a lot about you.

563
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:20,364
- Take a few weeks.
- Weeks?

564
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:24,949
Yeah, I don't have her stuffed down the front
of my pants right now, sorry to say.

565
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:26,874
But I'll get her.

566
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:28,417
Relax.

567
00:42:30,298 --> 00:42:31,584
Thanks.

568
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,257
It was. You should've seen his face.

569
00:42:34,427 --> 00:42:35,417
Sit down.

570
00:42:35,595 --> 00:42:36,756
Did you tell him what I'm...?7

571
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:38,169
Down in front.

572
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:41,510
- / Wanted to save that as a surprise.
- Hang on to your hat.

573
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,971
BALLIN ♪:
Gilda is my wife.

574
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:53,943
- Take a walk!
- I got to change the reel!

575
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:56,146
I said fuck off!

576
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:03,661
Ain't you going to scream?

577
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:06,865
Let's get this over with.

578
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:13,997
He broke my fucking nose!

579
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:24,515
Now...

580
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:27,181
...I'm going to open my fly...

581
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:30,180
...and you'll swallow
what I give you to swallow.

582
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:33,942
Then you'll swallow Rooster's.
You broke his nose.

583
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:36,269
I think ye ought to have
something to show for it.

584
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:38,355
Anything you put it in my mouth,
you'll lose it.

585
00:43:38,533 --> 00:43:41,150
No, you don't understand.

586
00:43:41,494 --> 00:43:44,532
Do that and I'll put all eight inches
of this steel in your ear.

587
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:48,198
All right, but you should know
that sudden, serious brain injury...

588
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:50,333
...causes the victim to bite down hard.

589
00:43:51,796 --> 00:43:54,037
In fact, I hear the bite reflex
is so strong...

590
00:43:54,841 --> 00:43:57,299
...they have to pry
the victim's jaws open...

591
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:58,875
...with a crowbar.

592
00:44:01,848 --> 00:44:03,384
Where do you get this shit?

593
00:44:03,558 --> 00:44:04,969
I read it.

594
00:44:06,394 --> 00:44:09,056
You know how to read,
you ignorant fuck?

595
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:12,017
Honey.

596
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:15,475
You shouldn't!

597
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:21,069
Bogs didn't put anything in Andy's mouth.

598
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:23,407
And neither did his friends.

599
00:44:23,828 --> 00:44:27,662
What they did do is beat him
within an inch of his life.

600
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:30,824
Andy spent a month in the infirmary.

601
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:34,164
Bogs spent a week in the hole.

602
00:44:38,259 --> 00:44:39,749
Time's up, Bogs.

603
00:44:43,598 --> 00:44:45,259
It's your world, boss.

604
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:51,307
Return to
your cellblocks for evening count.

605
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:54,184
All prisoners report for lockdown.

606
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:10,113
What?

607
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:25,295
- Where's he going?
- Grab his ankles.

608
00:45:28,643 --> 00:45:32,386
No! No! Help me!

609
00:45:36,067 --> 00:45:38,650
Two things never happened again
after that.

610
00:45:38,945 --> 00:45:42,063
The Sisters never
laid a finger on Andy again.

611
00:45:42,907 --> 00:45:45,399
And Bogs never walked again.

612
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:50,070
They transferred him
to a minimum-security hospital upstate.

613
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:52,781
To my knowledge,
he lived out the rest of his days...

614
00:45:52,959 --> 00:45:55,075
...drinking his food through a straw.

615
00:45:56,087 --> 00:46:00,172
Andy could use a nice "welcome back"
when he gets out of the infirmary.

616
00:46:01,926 --> 00:46:03,508
Sounds good to us.

617
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:06,253
I figure we owe him that much
for the beer.

618
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:09,255
The man likes to play chess.

619
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:11,678
Let's get him some rocks.

620
00:46:44,302 --> 00:46:45,542
Guys!

621
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:47,385
I got one.

622
00:46:47,555 --> 00:46:49,045
I got one. Look!

623
00:46:50,975 --> 00:46:55,060
Heywood, that isn't soapstone!
And it ain't alabaster either.

624
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:57,140
What are you, a fucking geologist?

625
00:46:57,356 --> 00:46:59,063
He's right. It ain't.

626
00:46:59,275 --> 00:47:02,188
- What the hell is it then?
- It's a horse apple.

627
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:05,566
- Bullshit!
- No, horseshit.

628
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:07,230
Petrified.

629
00:47:12,747 --> 00:47:14,738
Oh, Jesus.

630
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:17,411
Damn!

631
00:47:17,752 --> 00:47:21,962
Despite a few hitches,
the boys came through in fine style.

632
00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:24,164
And by the weekend
he was due back...

633
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:28,092
...we had enough rocks saved up
to keep him busy till rapture.

634
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:31,421
Also got a big shipment in that week.

635
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:32,797
Cigarettes...

636
00:47:33,017 --> 00:47:34,052
...chewing gum...

637
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:35,724
...Sipping whiskey...

638
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:39,304
...playing cards with naked ladies
on them. You name it.

639
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:42,265
And, of course, the most important item:

640
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:46,193
Rita Hayworth herself.

641
00:48:20,356 --> 00:48:23,098
- Okay, look alive!
- Open all tiers.

642
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:25,558
Heads up. They're tossing the cells.

643
00:48:25,778 --> 00:48:28,486
Heads up. They're tossing the cells!

644
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:31,564
119.

645
00:48:33,411 --> 00:48:35,072
123.

646
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:46,329
On your feet.

647
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:50,499
Face the wall.

648
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:26,539
Turn around and face the warden.

649
00:49:33,137 --> 00:49:35,219
Pleased to see you reading this.

650
00:49:36,557 --> 00:49:38,468
Any favorite passages?

651
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:41,718
"Watch ye, therefore,
for ye know not...

652
00:49:41,896 --> 00:49:44,137
...when the master
of the house cometh."

653
00:49:45,274 --> 00:49:47,436
Mark 13:35.

654
00:49:48,194 --> 00:49:50,060
I've always liked that one.

655
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:52,649
But I prefer:

656
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:54,981
"I am the light of the world.

657
00:49:55,451 --> 00:49:58,739
Ye that followeth me
shall have the light of life."

658
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:01,571
John, chapter 8, verse 12.

659
00:50:01,874 --> 00:50:03,911
I hear you're good with numbers.

660
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:05,074
How nice.

661
00:50:06,337 --> 00:50:08,248
Man should have a skill.

662
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:11,834
Wanna explain this?

663
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:17,095
It's called a rock blanket.
For shaping and polishing rocks.

664
00:50:17,515 --> 00:50:19,426
Al little hobby of mine.

665
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:31,733
It's pretty clean.

666
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:35,105
Some contraband here,
but nothing to get in a twist over.

667
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:41,444
I can't say I approve of this.

668
00:50:43,082 --> 00:50:44,538
But I suppose...

669
00:50:46,627 --> 00:50:48,618
...exceptions can be made.

670
00:50:58,973 --> 00:51:00,304
Lock them up!

671
00:51:03,227 --> 00:51:04,809
I almost forgot.

672
00:51:05,229 --> 00:51:07,391
I'd hate to deprive you of this.

673
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:10,059
Salvation lies within.

674
00:51:10,276 --> 00:51:11,311
Yes, sir.

675
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:22,451
Tossing cells was just an excuse.

676
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:24,153
Truth is...

677
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:26,823
...Norton wanted to size Andy up.

678
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:42,846
My wife made that in church group.

679
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:46,805
Very nice, sir.

680
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:49,845
You enjoy working the laundry?

681
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:53,186
No, sir. Not especially.

682
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:55,985
Perhaps we can find something more...

683
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:58,696
...befitting a man of your education.

684
00:52:06,749 --> 00:52:08,239
Hey, Jake. Where's Brooks?

685
00:52:08,876 --> 00:52:12,870
Andy. I thought I heard you out here.

686
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:15,083
I've been reassigned to you.

687
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:17,714
I know, they told me.

688
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:20,589
Ain't that a kick in the head?

689
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:23,091
Well, I'll give you the dime tour.

690
00:52:23,307 --> 00:52:24,468
Come on.

691
00:52:25,893 --> 00:52:27,600
Well, here she is.

692
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:29,802
The Shawshank Prison Library.

693
00:52:30,481 --> 00:52:32,472
<i>National Geographies...</i>

694
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,188
...Reader's Digest condensed books...

695
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:37,985
...and Louis L'Amour.

696
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:40,404
Look magazine.

697
00:52:40,741 --> 00:52:43,073
Erle Stanley Gardners.

698
00:52:43,327 --> 00:52:46,786
Every evening I load up the cart
and make my rounds.

699
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:49,659
I enter the names
on this clipboard here.

700
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:52,750
Easy, peasy, Japanese-y.

701
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:56,538
- Any questions?
- Brooks, how long have you been librarian?

702
00:52:56,757 --> 00:53:01,752
Oh... I come here in '05,
and they made me librarian in 1912.

703
00:53:03,097 --> 00:53:05,259
And have you ever had an assistant?

704
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:07,924
No. Not much to it, really.

705
00:53:08,686 --> 00:53:09,926
Why me? Why now?

706
00:53:10,354 --> 00:53:11,640
I don't know.

707
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:14,893
But it'd be nice to have
some company down here.

708
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:16,936
Dufresne!

709
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:28,452
That's him. That's the one.

710
00:53:36,088 --> 00:53:37,249
I'm Dekins.

711
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:39,292
I was...

712
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:43,801
...thinking about setting up some kind of
trust fund for my kids' educations.

713
00:53:46,098 --> 00:53:49,181
Oh. I see.

714
00:53:50,978 --> 00:53:52,889
Well, um...

715
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:57,272
Why don't we have a seat
and talk it over.

716
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:03,442
Brooks, do you have a piece of paper
and a pencil?

717
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:16,079
Thanks.

718
00:54:16,754 --> 00:54:17,835
So...

719
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:21,331
Mr. Dekins...

720
00:54:22,176 --> 00:54:24,258
And then Andy says, "Mr. Dekins...

721
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:27,462
...do you want your sons
to go to Harvard or Yale?"

722
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:28,716
He didn't say that!

723
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:31,549
As God as my witness!

724
00:54:31,852 --> 00:54:33,559
Dekins just blinked for a second...

725
00:54:33,771 --> 00:54:36,889
...then he laughed
and actually shook Andy's hand.

726
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:39,689
- My ass!
- Shook his hand.

727
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:42,727
I tell you, I near soiled myself!

728
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:47,190
All he needed was a suit and tie
and a jiggly hula gal on his desk...

729
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:50,026
...he'd have been
"Mr. Dufresne," if you please.

730
00:54:50,204 --> 00:54:51,865
Making a few friends, huh, Andy?

731
00:54:53,165 --> 00:54:54,826
I wouldn't say "friends."

732
00:54:55,042 --> 00:54:58,876
I'm a convicted murderer
who provides sound financial planning.

733
00:54:59,046 --> 00:55:01,378
It's a wonderful pet to have.

734
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:03,376
Got you out of the laundry, though.

735
00:55:03,926 --> 00:55:05,837
It might do more than that.

736
00:55:06,053 --> 00:55:08,761
How about expanding the library.
Get some new books.

737
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:11,555
If you ask for something,
ask for a pool table.

738
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:16,268
- Right.
- How do you expect to do that? I mean...

739
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:19,438
...get new books in here,
"Mr. Dufresne, if you please."”

740
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:21,390
I'll ask the warden for funds.

741
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:27,105
Son, son, son, six wardens have been
through here in my tenure, and I've learned...

742
00:55:27,366 --> 00:55:29,733
...one immutable, universal truth:

743
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:32,197
Not one of them born whose asshole...

744
00:55:32,371 --> 00:55:36,410
...wouldn't pucker up tighter than
a snare drum when you ask for funds.

745
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:40,205
- The budget's stretched thin as it is.
- I see.

746
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:43,833
Perhaps I could write the state senate
and request funds directly from them.

747
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:48,134
They have only three ways to spend
the taxpayers' money for prisons:

748
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:50,757
More walls, more bars, more guards.

749
00:55:50,973 --> 00:55:53,635
Still, I'd like to try, with permission.
A letter a week.

750
00:55:53,851 --> 00:55:56,593
- They can't ignore me forever.
- Sure can.

751
00:55:56,854 --> 00:55:59,516
But you write your letters
if it makes you happy.

752
00:55:59,815 --> 00:56:02,432
I'll even mail them for you. How's that?

753
00:56:04,111 --> 00:56:06,899
So Andy started writing
a letter a week...

754
00:56:07,114 --> 00:56:08,696
...just like he said.

755
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:15,487
And, just like Norton said...

756
00:56:15,706 --> 00:56:17,162
...Andy got no answers.

757
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:30,297
The following April, Andy did tax returns
for half the guards at Shawshank.

758
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:33,879
Year after that, he did them all...

759
00:56:34,141 --> 00:56:36,052
...Including the warden's.

760
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:41,270
Year after that,
they rescheduled the intramural season...

761
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:43,893
...to coincide with tax season.

762
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:49,945
The guards on the opposing teams
all remembered to bring their W-2s.

763
00:56:50,157 --> 00:56:53,946
So Moresby Prison issued you a gun,
but you actually paid for it.

764
00:56:54,161 --> 00:56:55,868
Damn right. The holster too.

765
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:58,537
See, that's tax-deductible.
You can write that off.

766
00:56:58,749 --> 00:57:01,787
Yes, sir.
Andy was a regular cottage industry.

767
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:06,996
In fact, it got so busy at tax time,
he was allowed a staff.

768
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:09,715
Could you hand me
a stack of 1040s?

769
00:57:09,927 --> 00:57:14,763
Got me out of the wood shop
a month out of the year, and that was fine.

770
00:57:16,016 --> 00:57:19,179
And still, he kept sending those letters.

771
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:25,773
Red. Red. Andy.

772
00:57:25,943 --> 00:57:26,978
It's Brooks.

773
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:29,601
Watch the door.

774
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:31,194
Please, Brooks.

775
00:57:31,365 --> 00:57:33,231
- Calm the fuck down.
- Stay back!

776
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,816
- Stay back, goddamn it!
- What's going on?

777
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:39,032
You tell me. One second he's fine,
then out come the knife.

778
00:57:39,206 --> 00:57:41,072
Brooks. We can talk about this, right?

779
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:45,083
There's nothing to talk about.
I'll cut his fucking throat.

780
00:57:45,379 --> 00:57:47,086
What's he done to you?

781
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:48,958
It's what they done!

782
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:50,706
I got no choice.

783
00:57:51,218 --> 00:57:53,505
Brooks, you won't hurt Heywood.
We all know that.

784
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:56,178
- Right, Heywood?
- Sure. I know that.

785
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:59,724
He's a friend of yours,
and Brooks is a reasonable man.

786
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:01,884
- Right, guys?
- Yes.

787
00:58:02,062 --> 00:58:04,554
So put the knife down.
Brooks, look at me.

788
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:08,725
Put the knife down. Brooks.

789
00:58:08,986 --> 00:58:11,068
Look at his neck, for God's sake.

790
00:58:11,822 --> 00:58:14,154
Look at his neck. He's bleeding.

791
00:58:15,075 --> 00:58:16,531
It's the only--

792
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:18,780
It's the only way they'd let me stay.

793
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:21,411
Come on, this is crazy.
You don't want to do this.

794
00:58:21,665 --> 00:58:23,747
Put it-- Put it down.

795
00:58:31,091 --> 00:58:34,004
Hey. Hey. Take it easy.

796
00:58:34,678 --> 00:58:36,260
You'll be all right.

797
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:38,888
Him? What about me?

798
00:58:39,099 --> 00:58:41,466
Crazy old fool damn near cut my throat!

799
00:58:41,685 --> 00:58:43,596
You've had worse from shaving.

800
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:45,511
What did you do to set him off?

801
00:58:45,689 --> 00:58:48,306
Nothing. I come in here to say farewell.

802
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:51,604
Ain't you heard?
His parole's come through.

803
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:56,738
I just don't understand
what happened in there, that's all.

804
00:58:56,908 --> 00:58:59,741
Old man's crazy as a rat
in a tin shithouse.

805
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:01,819
Oh, Heywood, that's enough out of you.

806
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:04,781
- Heard he had you shitting in your pants.
- Fuck you.

807
00:59:05,042 --> 00:59:06,248
Knock it off.

808
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:08,621
Brooks ain't no bug.

809
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:10,623
He's just--

810
00:59:12,466 --> 00:59:14,252
He's just institutionalized.

811
00:59:15,635 --> 00:59:17,546
"Institutionalized," my ass.

812
00:59:17,763 --> 00:59:21,757
The man's been in here 50 years,
Heywood, 50 years!

813
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:23,682
This is all he knows.

814
00:59:23,894 --> 00:59:26,181
In here, he's an important man...

815
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:27,477
...an educated man.

816
00:59:28,315 --> 00:59:30,226
Outside, he's nothing.

817
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:34,602
Just a used-up con
with arthritis in both hands.

818
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:37,813
Probably couldn't get a library card
if he tried.

819
00:59:38,075 --> 00:59:39,816
You know what I'm trying to say?

820
00:59:40,077 --> 00:59:42,990
I do believe
you're talking out of your ass.

821
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:46,488
You believe whatever you want.

822
00:59:47,084 --> 00:59:49,496
But I tell you these walls are funny.

823
00:59:51,088 --> 00:59:52,749
First you hate them.

824
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:56,502
Then you get used to them.

825
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:00,419
Enough time passes...

826
01:00:01,098 --> 01:00:03,089
...you get so you depend on them.

827
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:06,308
That's "institutionalized."

828
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:10,764
- Shit. I could never get like that.
- Oh, yeah?

829
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:14,142
Wait till you've been here
as long as Brooks.

830
01:00:14,361 --> 01:00:15,943
Goddamn right.

831
01:00:18,532 --> 01:00:20,443
They send you here for life...

832
01:00:21,118 --> 01:00:23,450
...that's exactly what they take.

833
01:00:25,205 --> 01:00:27,196
Part that counts, anyway.

834
01:00:34,798 --> 01:00:37,711
I can't take care of you no more, Jake.

835
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:40,546
You go on now.

836
01:00:41,805 --> 01:00:43,295
You're free.

837
01:00:44,558 --> 01:00:46,140
You're free.

838
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:04,987
Bye. Joe?

839
01:01:05,162 --> 01:01:06,823
Good luck, Brooksie.

840
01:01:09,124 --> 01:01:11,206
Take care of yourself, Brooks.

841
01:01:44,784 --> 01:01:46,274
Dear fellas:

842
01:01:46,578 --> 01:01:50,788
I can't believe how fast things move
on the outside.

843
01:01:52,083 --> 01:01:54,745
Watch it, old-timer! Want to get killed?

844
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:59,455
[Saw an automobile once
when I was a kid...

845
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:02,545
...but now they're everywhere.

846
01:02:06,223 --> 01:02:10,512
The world went and got itself
in a big damn hurry.

847
01:02:26,326 --> 01:02:30,115
The parole board
got me into this halfway house...

848
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:32,074
...called "The Brewer"...

849
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:33,451
...and a job...

850
01:02:33,667 --> 01:02:36,625
...bagging groceries at the Food-Way.

851
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:40,583
It's hard work and I try to keep up...

852
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:43,166
...but my hands hurt most of the time.

853
01:02:43,468 --> 01:02:48,338
Make sure your man double-bags.
Last time, the bottom near came out.

854
01:02:48,515 --> 01:02:51,257
Make sure you double-bag
like the lady says. Understand?

855
01:02:51,476 --> 01:02:52,841
Yes, sir. Surely will.

856
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:56,557
I don't think the store manager
likes me very much.

857
01:02:59,567 --> 01:03:03,856
Sometimes after work,
I go to the park and feed the birds.

858
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:05,812
I keep thinking...

859
01:03:06,032 --> 01:03:09,366
...Jake might just show up
and say hello.

860
01:03:09,995 --> 01:03:11,986
But he never does.

861
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:18,042
I hope, wherever he is, he's doing okay
and making new friends.

862
01:03:21,673 --> 01:03:24,381
I have trouble sleeping at night.

863
01:03:24,718 --> 01:03:27,961
I have bad dreams, like I'm falling.

864
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:30,462
I wake up scared.

865
01:03:30,682 --> 01:03:34,892
Sometimes it takes me a while
to remember where I am.

866
01:03:36,396 --> 01:03:41,311
Maybe I should get me a gun and rob
the Food-Way so they'd send me home.

867
01:03:41,609 --> 01:03:45,944
I could shoot the manager while
! Was at it. Sort of like a bonus.

868
01:03:47,615 --> 01:03:51,609
I guess I'm too old
for that sort of nonsense anymore.

869
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:53,577
I don't like it here.

870
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:57,782
I'm tired of being afraid all the time.
I've decided...

871
01:03:58,626 --> 01:04:00,287
...not to stay.

872
01:04:11,222 --> 01:04:13,759
I doubt they'll kick up any fuss...

873
01:04:13,975 --> 01:04:17,468
...hot for an old crook like me.

874
01:05:19,958 --> 01:05:24,202
"I doubt they'll kick up any fuss,
not for an old crook like me.

875
01:05:25,255 --> 01:05:29,089
P.S. Tell Heywood I'm sorry
I put a knife to his throat.

876
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:31,632
No hard feelings. Brooks."

877
01:05:42,105 --> 01:05:44,062
He should have died in here.

878
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:51,023
What the fuck have you done?

879
01:05:51,197 --> 01:05:53,859
It's a goddamn mess,
I'll tell you that.

880
01:05:59,414 --> 01:06:03,157
- What's all this?
- You tell me. They're addressed to you.

881
01:06:04,419 --> 01:06:05,750
Take it.

882
01:06:14,304 --> 01:06:15,794
"Dear Mr. Dufresne:

883
01:06:16,931 --> 01:06:18,888
In response to your repeated inquiries...

884
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:23,389
...the state has allocated the enclosed
funds for your library project."

885
01:06:24,147 --> 01:06:25,979
This is $200.

886
01:06:26,191 --> 01:06:30,185
"In addition, the library district
has generously responded...

887
01:06:30,403 --> 01:06:32,940
...with a donation of used books
and sundries.

888
01:06:33,156 --> 01:06:37,275
We trust this will fill your needs.
We now consider the matter closed.

889
01:06:37,494 --> 01:06:39,360
Please stop sending us letters."

890
01:06:39,537 --> 01:06:42,199
I want all this cleared out
before the warden gets back.

891
01:06:42,415 --> 01:06:43,576
Yes, sir.

892
01:06:47,879 --> 01:06:49,040
Good for you, Andy.

893
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:53,252
Wow.

894
01:06:54,344 --> 01:06:56,255
It only took six years.

895
01:06:57,847 --> 01:07:00,589
From now on, I'll write two
letters a week instead of one.

896
01:07:00,767 --> 01:07:04,101
I believe you're crazy enough.
Get this stuff out...

897
01:07:04,395 --> 01:07:06,807
...like he said.
I've got to pinch a loaf.

898
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:08,479
When I come back...

899
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:10,432
...this is all gone, all right?

900
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,611
Do you hear that?

901
01:09:09,604 --> 01:09:12,813
Dufresne! Dufresne!

902
01:09:13,066 --> 01:09:14,556
Andy, let me out!

903
01:09:21,449 --> 01:09:26,410
I have no idea to this day what those
two Italian ladies were singing about.

904
01:09:26,704 --> 01:09:28,911
Truth is, I don't want to know.

905
01:09:29,123 --> 01:09:31,615
Some things are best left unsaid.

906
01:09:35,213 --> 01:09:37,921
! Like to think it was something
so beautiful...

907
01:09:38,132 --> 01:09:40,248
...It can't be expressed in words...

908
01:09:40,468 --> 01:09:43,381
...and makes your heart ache
because of it.

909
01:09:45,056 --> 01:09:47,548
I tell you, those voices soared...

910
01:09:47,809 --> 01:09:52,098
...higher and farther than anybody
in a gray place dares to dream.

911
01:09:52,313 --> 01:09:55,681
It was like a beautiful bird
flapped into our drab cage...

912
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:58,642
...and made those walls dissolve away.

913
01:09:59,112 --> 01:10:01,274
And for the briefest of moments...

914
01:10:01,489 --> 01:10:04,481
...every last man at Shawshank felt free.

915
01:10:07,078 --> 01:10:09,740
It pissed the warden off
something awful.

916
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,030
Open the door.

917
01:10:14,961 --> 01:10:16,702
Open it up!

918
01:10:18,005 --> 01:10:20,747
Dufresne, open this door!

919
01:10:22,093 --> 01:10:23,299
Turn that off!

920
01:10:30,351 --> 01:10:32,809
I am warning you. Turn that off!

921
01:10:46,659 --> 01:10:48,570
Dufresne.

922
01:10:50,538 --> 01:10:52,074
You're mine now.

923
01:10:59,505 --> 01:11:02,748
Andy got two weeks in the hole
for that little stunt.

924
01:11:02,967 --> 01:11:04,549
On your feet.

925
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:08,132
- Hey, look who's here.
- Maestro!

926
01:11:08,306 --> 01:11:09,512
Hey.

927
01:11:09,891 --> 01:11:13,555
You couldn't play something good, huh?
Like Hank Williams?

928
01:11:13,895 --> 01:11:16,683
They broke the door down
before I could take requests.

929
01:11:16,898 --> 01:11:20,016
- Was it worth two weeks?
- Easiest time I ever did.

930
01:11:20,234 --> 01:11:22,566
No such thing as easy time in the hole.

931
01:11:22,737 --> 01:11:24,444
A week in the hole is like a year.

932
01:11:24,655 --> 01:11:27,943
- Damn straight.
- I had Mr. Mozart to keep me company.

933
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:31,117
So they let you tote
that record player down there, huh?

934
01:11:33,539 --> 01:11:34,904
It was in here.

935
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:36,990
In here.

936
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:40,209
That's the beauty of music. They...

937
01:11:40,421 --> 01:11:42,753
...can't get that from you.

938
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:48,669
Haven't you ever felt
that way about music?

939
01:11:50,473 --> 01:11:53,591
Well, I played a mean harmonica
as a younger man.

940
01:11:54,644 --> 01:11:56,351
Lost interest in it, though.

941
01:11:56,562 --> 01:11:58,144
Didn't make much sense in here.

942
01:11:58,481 --> 01:12:00,472
Here's where it makes the most sense.

943
01:12:01,025 --> 01:12:03,062
You need it so you don't forget.

944
01:12:03,653 --> 01:12:04,939
Forget?

945
01:12:05,238 --> 01:12:08,321
Forget that there are...

946
01:12:08,533 --> 01:12:09,944
...places...

947
01:12:10,451 --> 01:12:14,285
...in the world
that aren't made out of stone.

948
01:12:15,289 --> 01:12:16,779
There's something...

949
01:12:17,124 --> 01:12:18,535
...inside...

950
01:12:18,793 --> 01:12:20,750
...that they can't get to...

951
01:12:20,962 --> 01:12:22,373
...that they can't touch.

952
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:24,291
That's yours.

953
01:12:25,842 --> 01:12:27,424
What are you talking about?

954
01:12:28,469 --> 01:12:29,709
Hope.

955
01:12:30,763 --> 01:12:32,094
Hope.

956
01:12:34,058 --> 01:12:36,049
Let me tell you something, my friend.

957
01:12:36,853 --> 01:12:39,140
Hope is a dangerous thing.

958
01:12:40,314 --> 01:12:42,646
Hope can drive a man insane.

959
01:12:43,401 --> 01:12:45,517
It's got no use on the inside.

960
01:12:45,736 --> 01:12:47,943
You'd better get used to that idea.

961
01:12:50,449 --> 01:12:51,939
Like Brooks did?

962
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:18,300
Sit down.

963
01:13:23,649 --> 01:13:26,937
Says here that you've served
30 years of a life sentence.

964
01:13:28,112 --> 01:13:30,149
You feel you've been rehabilitated?

965
01:13:30,364 --> 01:13:31,604
Oh, yes, sir.

966
01:13:32,867 --> 01:13:34,198
Without a doubt.

967
01:13:35,369 --> 01:13:37,781
I can honestly say I'm a changed man.

968
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:41,701
No danger to society here.

969
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:43,787
God's honest truth.

970
01:13:46,339 --> 01:13:48,455
Absolutely rehabilitated.

971
01:13:58,434 --> 01:13:59,765
Thirty years.

972
01:14:01,729 --> 01:14:03,640
Jesus, when you say it like that...

973
01:14:04,523 --> 01:14:06,309
You wonder where it went.

974
01:14:08,736 --> 01:14:10,898
I wonder where 10 years went.

975
01:14:15,868 --> 01:14:16,903
Here.

976
01:14:17,370 --> 01:14:20,078
A little parole-rejection present.

977
01:14:21,374 --> 01:14:23,035
Go ahead and open it.

978
01:14:24,168 --> 01:14:26,205
Went through one of your competitors.

979
01:14:26,379 --> 01:14:29,542
I hope you don't mind.
I wanted it to be a surprise.

980
01:14:39,558 --> 01:14:41,048
It's very pretty.

981
01:14:42,770 --> 01:14:43,976
Thank you.

982
01:14:46,565 --> 01:14:48,021
You going to play it?

983
01:14:52,571 --> 01:14:53,857
No.

984
01:14:57,451 --> 01:14:58,862
Not right now.

985
01:15:16,554 --> 01:15:17,635
Roll in!

986
01:15:53,841 --> 01:15:55,081
Lights out!

987
01:16:29,668 --> 01:16:31,830
Andy was as good as his word.

988
01:16:32,171 --> 01:16:34,959
He wrote two letters a week
instead of one.

989
01:16:37,009 --> 01:16:41,128
In 1959, the state senate
finally clued in to the fact...

990
01:16:41,347 --> 01:16:44,510
...they couldn't buy him off
with just a $200 check.

991
01:16:44,683 --> 01:16:49,018
Appropriations Committee
voted an annual payment of $500...

992
01:16:49,188 --> 01:16:51,099
...just to shut him up.

993
01:16:51,315 --> 01:16:54,307
And you'd be amazed how far
Andy could stretch it.

994
01:16:54,527 --> 01:16:57,440
He made deals with book clubs,
charity groups.

995
01:16:57,655 --> 01:17:00,397
He bought remaindered books
by the pound...

996
01:17:00,908 --> 01:17:02,444
"Treasure Island.”

997
01:17:02,993 --> 01:17:04,324
Robert Louis--

998
01:17:04,537 --> 01:17:05,527
Stevenson.

999
01:17:05,746 --> 01:17:07,157
Fiction, adventure.

1000
01:17:09,708 --> 01:17:10,743
What's next?

1001
01:17:10,918 --> 01:17:14,001
I got here Auto Repair...

1002
01:17:14,713 --> 01:17:15,874
...and Soap Carving.

1003
01:17:16,090 --> 01:17:19,333
Trade skills and hobbies.
Under "Educational," behind you.

1004
01:17:19,552 --> 01:17:21,384
"Count of Monte Crisco."

1005
01:17:21,887 --> 01:17:24,174
That's "Cristo,"” you dumb-shit.

1006
01:17:25,266 --> 01:17:26,256
By Alexandree...

1007
01:17:26,725 --> 01:17:28,011
...Dum-ass.

1008
01:17:28,352 --> 01:17:29,387
Dumb-ass.

1009
01:17:31,689 --> 01:17:32,724
Dumb-ass?

1010
01:17:35,651 --> 01:17:38,939
- Dumas. Know what that's about?
- Huh.

1011
01:17:39,905 --> 01:17:41,896
You'd like it. It's about a prison break.

1012
01:17:42,074 --> 01:17:45,942
We ought to file that
under "Educational” too, oughtn't we?

1013
01:17:46,829 --> 01:17:50,914
The rest of us did our best
to pitch in when and where we could.

1014
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:53,241
By the year Kennedy was shot...

1015
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:57,996
...Andy had transformed a storage room
smelling of turpentine...

1016
01:17:58,299 --> 01:18:01,417
...into the best prison library
in New England...

1017
01:18:02,094 --> 01:18:05,052
...complete with a fine selection
of Hank Williams.

1018
01:18:12,438 --> 01:18:14,349
That was also when Warden Norton...

1019
01:18:14,565 --> 01:18:17,478
...Instituted his famous
"Inside Out" program.

1020
01:18:17,943 --> 01:18:20,025
You may remember reading about it.

1021
01:18:20,279 --> 01:18:23,362
It made the papers
and got his picture in Look magazine.

1022
01:18:23,574 --> 01:18:24,905
It's no free ride...

1023
01:18:25,075 --> 01:18:28,284
...but rather a genuine
progressive advance...

1024
01:18:28,495 --> 01:18:30,987
...In corrections and rehabilitation.

1025
01:18:31,332 --> 01:18:33,869
Our inmates, properly supervised...

1026
01:18:34,084 --> 01:18:36,701
...will be put to work
outside these walls...

1027
01:18:36,921 --> 01:18:40,004
...performing all manner
of public service.

1028
01:18:40,174 --> 01:18:42,962
These men can learn the value
of an honest day's labor...

1029
01:18:43,177 --> 01:18:46,966
...while providing a valuable service
to the community...

1030
01:18:47,181 --> 01:18:51,891
...and at a bare minimum of expense
to Mr. And Mrs. John Q. Taxpayer.

1031
01:18:52,311 --> 01:18:54,643
Of course he didn't tell the press...

1032
01:18:54,855 --> 01:18:58,314
...that "bare minimum of expense"
is a fairly loose term.

1033
01:18:58,525 --> 01:19:01,563
There are 100 different ways
to skim off the top.

1034
01:19:01,779 --> 01:19:04,271
Men, materials, you name it.

1035
01:19:04,615 --> 01:19:07,482
And oh, my Lord,
how the money rolled in!

1036
01:19:07,701 --> 01:19:10,238
- You'll put me out of business.
- Ned.

1037
01:19:10,454 --> 01:19:14,869
With this pool of slave labor,
you can underbid any contractor in town.

1038
01:19:15,459 --> 01:19:18,417
We're providing
a valuable community service.

1039
01:19:18,629 --> 01:19:23,965
That's fine for the papers,
but I've got a family to feed. Sam.

1040
01:19:24,969 --> 01:19:26,505
<i>We go back along way, Sam.</i>

1041
01:19:27,805 --> 01:19:32,720
I need this new highway contract.
I don't get it and I go under. That's a fact.

1042
01:19:33,644 --> 01:19:35,430
You have some of this fine pie...

1043
01:19:35,688 --> 01:19:39,022
...my missus made especially for you.
You think about that.

1044
01:19:47,283 --> 01:19:49,991
Ned, I wouldn't worry too much
about this contract.

1045
01:19:50,202 --> 01:19:53,285
It seems to me I already got my boys
committed elsewhere.

1046
01:19:55,249 --> 01:19:58,332
You be sure and thank Maisie
for this fine pie.

1047
01:19:59,420 --> 01:20:01,582
And behind every shady deal...

1048
01:20:01,922 --> 01:20:04,539
...behind every dollar earned...

1049
01:20:04,842 --> 01:20:07,880
...there was Andy, keeping the books.

1050
01:20:08,304 --> 01:20:09,544
Two deposits.

1051
01:20:09,805 --> 01:20:13,924
Maine National and New England First.
Night drops as always, sir.

1052
01:20:44,131 --> 01:20:48,466
Get my stuff to the laundry. Two suits
for dry-clean and a bag of whatnot.

1053
01:20:48,927 --> 01:20:51,840
If they over-starch my shirts again,
they'll hear from me.

1054
01:20:52,014 --> 01:20:54,005
- Yes, Sir.
- How do I look?

1055
01:20:55,059 --> 01:20:57,551
- Very nice.
- Big charity to-do up Portland way.

1056
01:20:57,770 --> 01:20:59,260
- Governor will be there.
- Hmm.

1057
01:21:00,689 --> 01:21:02,145
You want the rest of this?

1058
01:21:03,484 --> 01:21:05,441
Woman can't bake worth shit.

1059
01:21:06,653 --> 01:21:07,984
Thank you, sir.

1060
01:21:10,824 --> 01:21:14,067
He's got his fingers
in a lot of pies, from what I hear.

1061
01:21:14,286 --> 01:21:19,122
He's got scams you haven't even
dreamed of. Kickbacks on his kickbacks.

1062
01:21:19,291 --> 01:21:21,658
A river of dirty money
running through here.

1063
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:25,711
Sooner or later, he'll have to
explain where it came from.

1064
01:21:25,923 --> 01:21:27,664
That's where I come in.

1065
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:30,587
I channel it. Filter it. Funnel it.

1066
01:21:30,803 --> 01:21:33,636
Stocks, securities,
tax-free municipals.

1067
01:21:33,972 --> 01:21:37,465
I send it out into the real world,
and when it comes back...

1068
01:21:37,684 --> 01:21:40,642
- Clean as a virgin's honeypot, huh?
- Cleaner.

1069
01:21:41,271 --> 01:21:44,855
By the time Norton retires,
I'll have made him a millionaire.

1070
01:21:47,194 --> 01:21:51,529
If they ever catch on, he'll wind up
in here wearing a number himself.

1071
01:21:51,824 --> 01:21:54,486
I thought you had
more faith in me than that.

1072
01:21:54,701 --> 01:21:57,739
I know you're good,
but all that paper leaves a trail.

1073
01:21:58,122 --> 01:21:59,954
Now anybody gets curious--

1074
01:22:00,124 --> 01:22:02,536
FBI, IRS, whatever.

1075
01:22:03,001 --> 01:22:04,287
--It'll lead to somebody.

1076
01:22:04,503 --> 01:22:08,337
Sure it is, but not to me,
and certainly not to the warden.

1077
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:13,709
All right, who?

1078
01:22:13,887 --> 01:22:15,503
Randall Stevens.

1079
01:22:16,014 --> 01:22:17,004
Who?

1080
01:22:17,182 --> 01:22:19,173
The "silent" silent partner.

1081
01:22:19,393 --> 01:22:22,476
He's the guilty one,
the man with the bank accounts.

1082
01:22:22,688 --> 01:22:24,850
It's where the filtering
process starts.

1083
01:22:25,023 --> 01:22:27,890
They trace anything,
it'll just lead to him.

1084
01:22:28,527 --> 01:22:29,733
But who is he?

1085
01:22:29,945 --> 01:22:33,904
He's a phantom, an apparition.
Second cousin to Harvey the Rabbit.

1086
01:22:35,033 --> 01:22:36,194
I conjured him...

1087
01:22:36,368 --> 01:22:37,733
...out of thin air.

1088
01:22:38,537 --> 01:22:41,279
He doesn't exist, except on paper.

1089
01:22:44,376 --> 01:22:46,708
Andy, you can't just make a person up.

1090
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:50,038
Sure you can,
if you know how the system works.

1091
01:22:50,549 --> 01:22:53,382
It's amazing what you
can accomplish by mail.

1092
01:22:53,719 --> 01:22:56,336
Mr. Stevens has a birth certificate...

1093
01:22:56,555 --> 01:22:58,671
...driver's license, Social Security number.

1094
01:22:58,932 --> 01:22:59,922
You're shitting me.

1095
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:03,513
If they trace any accounts,
they'll wind up chasing...

1096
01:23:03,729 --> 01:23:05,436
...a figment of my imagination.

1097
01:23:05,647 --> 01:23:07,638
Well, I'll be damned!

1098
01:23:08,984 --> 01:23:10,725
Did I say you were good?

1099
01:23:11,069 --> 01:23:12,730
Shit, you are Rembrandt.

1100
01:23:13,447 --> 01:23:15,188
The funny thing is...

1101
01:23:15,407 --> 01:23:19,492
...on the outside, I was an honest man,
straight as an arrow.

1102
01:23:19,912 --> 01:23:22,244
I had to come to prison to be a crook.

1103
01:23:31,089 --> 01:23:32,420
Ever bother you?

1104
01:23:33,842 --> 01:23:36,925
I don't run the scams.
I just process the profits.

1105
01:23:37,179 --> 01:23:39,170
A fine line, maybe...

1106
01:23:39,765 --> 01:23:41,802
...but I also built that library...

1107
01:23:42,017 --> 01:23:45,055
...and used it to help guys
get their high school diploma.

1108
01:23:45,270 --> 01:23:47,477
Why do you think
he lets me do all that?

1109
01:23:47,689 --> 01:23:49,896
Keep you happy and doing the laundry.

1110
01:23:50,108 --> 01:23:51,564
Money instead of sheets.

1111
01:23:51,944 --> 01:23:54,481
Well, I work cheap.
That's the tradeoff.

1112
01:24:11,797 --> 01:24:14,414
Tommy Williams came
to Shawshank in 1965...

1113
01:24:14,633 --> 01:24:16,874
...on a two-year stretch for B and E.

1114
01:24:17,135 --> 01:24:19,467
That's breaking and entering to you.

1115
01:24:19,721 --> 01:24:23,965
Cops caught him sneaking TV sets
out the back door of a JC Penney.

1116
01:24:24,393 --> 01:24:25,679
Young punk.

1117
01:24:25,894 --> 01:24:27,510
Mr. Rock 'n' Roll...

1118
01:24:27,729 --> 01:24:29,265
<i>...cocky as hell.</i>

1119
01:24:29,481 --> 01:24:31,848
Come on, old boys.
Moving like molasses!

1120
01:24:32,109 --> 01:24:33,850
Making me look bad.

1121
01:24:34,069 --> 01:24:35,855
We liked him immediately.

1122
01:24:36,113 --> 01:24:39,822
I'm backing out the door
and I got the TV like this.

1123
01:24:40,158 --> 01:24:43,776
A big old thing. I couldn't see shit.
Then I hear this voice.

1124
01:24:44,413 --> 01:24:46,370
"Freeze, kid, hands in the air.”

1125
01:24:46,582 --> 01:24:51,042
I was standing there, holding onto
that TV. Finally the voice says:

1126
01:24:51,253 --> 01:24:55,042
"You hear what I said, boy?"
I say, "Yes, sir. I sure did.

1127
01:24:55,257 --> 01:24:58,716
But if I drop this, you get me
on destruction of property too."

1128
01:25:03,181 --> 01:25:05,843
Hey, you done some stretch
in Cashman, right?

1129
01:25:06,018 --> 01:25:09,977
Yeah, that was an easy piece of time,
let me tell you.

1130
01:25:10,230 --> 01:25:12,187
Weekend furloughs. Work programs.

1131
01:25:12,858 --> 01:25:14,144
Not like here.

1132
01:25:14,318 --> 01:25:16,059
Sounds like you done time all over.

1133
01:25:16,528 --> 01:25:18,895
Yeah, I've been in and out since I was 13.

1134
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:21,321
You name it, chances are I've been there.

1135
01:25:21,533 --> 01:25:24,195
Perhaps you should try a new profession.

1136
01:25:25,621 --> 01:25:27,203
What I mean is...

1137
01:25:27,539 --> 01:25:30,497
...you're not a very good thief.
You should try something else.

1138
01:25:31,209 --> 01:25:34,418
Yeah, what the hell
you know about it, Capone?

1139
01:25:34,838 --> 01:25:36,420
What are you in for?

1140
01:25:36,715 --> 01:25:37,705
Me?

1141
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:41,796
A lawyer fucked me.

1142
01:25:45,724 --> 01:25:48,682
Everybody's innocent in here.
Don't you know that?

1143
01:25:56,568 --> 01:26:00,983
As it turned out, Tommy had himself
a young wife and a new baby girl.

1144
01:26:01,573 --> 01:26:03,689
Maybe he thought of them
on the streets...

1145
01:26:03,909 --> 01:26:06,401
...or his child growing up
not knowing her daddy.

1146
01:26:06,703 --> 01:26:08,068
Whatever it was...

1147
01:26:08,413 --> 01:26:10,825
...something lit a fire
under that boy's ass.

1148
01:26:14,670 --> 01:26:17,537
Thought I might try for
my high school equivalency.

1149
01:26:17,756 --> 01:26:20,248
Hear you helped
a couple of fellas with that.

1150
01:26:21,593 --> 01:26:23,834
I don't waste time with losers, Tommy.

1151
01:26:25,263 --> 01:26:27,755
I ain't no goddamn loser.

1152
01:26:29,476 --> 01:26:31,308
- You mean that?
- Yeah.

1153
01:26:32,979 --> 01:26:34,435
You really mean that?

1154
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:36,805
Yes, sir, I do.

1155
01:26:37,025 --> 01:26:38,982
Good. Because if we do this...

1156
01:26:39,194 --> 01:26:43,153
...we do it all the way,
a hundred percent, nothing half-assed.

1157
01:26:43,407 --> 01:26:45,193
Thing is, see...

1158
01:26:46,451 --> 01:26:47,987
...I don't read so good.

1159
01:26:49,162 --> 01:26:50,277
"Well."

1160
01:26:52,290 --> 01:26:53,997
You don't read...

1161
01:26:54,251 --> 01:26:55,787
...So well.

1162
01:26:58,130 --> 01:26:59,620
We'll get to that.

1163
01:27:04,052 --> 01:27:06,168
So Andy took Tommy under his wing.

1164
01:27:06,388 --> 01:27:09,005
Started walking him through his ABC's.

1165
01:27:11,143 --> 01:27:13,350
Tommy took to it pretty well too.

1166
01:27:13,645 --> 01:27:16,387
Boy found brains he never knew he had.

1167
01:27:18,734 --> 01:27:22,147
Before long, Andy started him
on his course requirements.

1168
01:27:22,362 --> 01:27:24,023
He really liked the kid.

1169
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:27,823
Gave him a thrill to help a youngster
crawl! Off the shit heap.

1170
01:27:28,326 --> 01:27:30,567
But that wasn't the only reason.

1171
01:27:31,288 --> 01:27:33,495
Prison time is slow time.

1172
01:27:33,957 --> 01:27:36,540
So you do what you can to keep going.

1173
01:27:36,877 --> 01:27:38,959
Some fellas collect stamps.

1174
01:27:39,337 --> 01:27:41,829
Others build matchstick houses.

1175
01:27:42,424 --> 01:27:45,086
Andy built a library.

1176
01:27:45,594 --> 01:27:47,505
Now he needed a new project.

1177
01:27:48,388 --> 01:27:49,878
Tommy was it.

1178
01:27:50,515 --> 01:27:54,509
It was the same reason he spent years
shaping and polishing those rocks.

1179
01:27:55,061 --> 01:27:58,304
The same reason he hung
his fantasy girlies on the wall.

1180
01:27:59,191 --> 01:28:00,477
In prison...

1181
01:28:00,734 --> 01:28:04,477
...a man will do most anything
to keep his mind occupied.

1182
01:28:05,238 --> 01:28:10,108
By 1966, right about the time Tommy
was getting ready to take his exams...

1183
01:28:10,368 --> 01:28:12,530
...lit was lovely Raquel.

1184
01:28:29,095 --> 01:28:30,085
Time.

1185
01:28:36,144 --> 01:28:37,384
Well?

1186
01:28:38,730 --> 01:28:40,892
Well, it's for shit.

1187
01:28:41,399 --> 01:28:44,232
I wasted a whole year
of my time with this bullshit.

1188
01:28:44,402 --> 01:28:45,892
It's probably not that bad.

1189
01:28:46,112 --> 01:28:50,356
Yeah, I didn't get a thing right.
It might as well have been in Chinese.

1190
01:28:50,575 --> 01:28:52,282
Let's see how the score comes out.

1191
01:28:52,494 --> 01:28:55,452
Yeah, well, I'll tell you
how the goddamn score comes out.

1192
01:28:57,415 --> 01:28:58,746
Two points, right there!

1193
01:28:58,959 --> 01:29:00,541
There's your goddamn score!

1194
01:29:00,752 --> 01:29:04,461
Goddamn cats crawling up trees,
5 times 5 is 25...

1195
01:29:05,423 --> 01:29:07,039
Fuck this place!

1196
01:29:07,259 --> 01:29:08,420
Fuck it!

1197
01:29:27,571 --> 01:29:28,811
I feel bad.

1198
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:30,236
I let him down.

1199
01:29:30,448 --> 01:29:32,155
That's crap, kid.

1200
01:29:32,367 --> 01:29:33,698
He's proud of you.

1201
01:29:34,035 --> 01:29:36,902
We're old friends,
I know him as good as anybody.

1202
01:29:37,122 --> 01:29:38,658
Smart fellow, ain't he?

1203
01:29:38,874 --> 01:29:41,992
Smart as they come.
He was a banker on the outside.

1204
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:44,451
What's he in here for anyway?

1205
01:29:44,754 --> 01:29:45,744
Murder.

1206
01:29:47,215 --> 01:29:50,003
- The hell, you say.
- Hmm.

1207
01:29:50,719 --> 01:29:53,051
You wouldn't think it
to look at the guy.

1208
01:29:54,306 --> 01:29:58,391
Caught his wife in bed
with some golf pro. Greased them both.

1209
01:30:06,401 --> 01:30:07,766
What?

1210
01:30:08,737 --> 01:30:11,320
About four years ago...

1211
01:30:11,573 --> 01:30:14,816
...was in Thomaston
on a two-to-three stretch.

1212
01:30:15,327 --> 01:30:16,613
I stole a car.

1213
01:30:16,995 --> 01:30:18,986
It was a dumb-fuck thing to do.

1214
01:30:19,664 --> 01:30:21,871
About six months left to go...

1215
01:30:22,167 --> 01:30:24,078
...get a new cellmate in.

1216
01:30:24,794 --> 01:30:26,410
Elmo Blatch.

1217
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:28,461
Big, twitchy fucker.

1218
01:30:29,341 --> 01:30:32,834
Kind of roomie you pray you don't get.
You know what I'm saying?

1219
01:30:33,011 --> 01:30:35,753
Six-to-twelve, armed burglary.

1220
01:30:36,014 --> 01:30:38,301
Said he pulled hundreds of jobs.

1221
01:30:38,516 --> 01:30:43,431
Hard to believe, high-strung as he was.
You cut a loud fart, he jumped three feet.

1222
01:30:44,522 --> 01:30:49,141
Talked all the time too.
That's the other thing. He never shut up.

1223
01:30:49,361 --> 01:30:50,977
Places he'd been in...

1224
01:30:51,279 --> 01:30:54,362
...jobs he'd pulled, women he fucked.

1225
01:30:54,574 --> 01:30:56,781
Even people he killed.

1226
01:30:58,036 --> 01:31:00,824
People who "gave him shit."

1227
01:31:01,456 --> 01:31:03,038
That's how he put it.

1228
01:31:04,209 --> 01:31:07,702
So one night, like a joke...

1229
01:31:08,797 --> 01:31:12,290
...I say to him,
"Yeah, Elmo, who did you kill?"

1230
01:31:12,550 --> 01:31:13,665
So he says:

1231
01:31:13,843 --> 01:31:17,802
I got me this job one time,
busing tables at a country club...

1232
01:31:18,473 --> 01:31:22,387
...80 I could case all these big
rich pricks that come in.

1233
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:26,470
So I pick out this guy...

1234
01:31:27,399 --> 01:31:28,935
...go in one night...

1235
01:31:29,150 --> 01:31:30,891
...and do his place.

1236
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:33,651
He wakes up...

1237
01:31:34,406 --> 01:31:36,147
...and gives me shit.

1238
01:31:37,242 --> 01:31:38,903
So I killed him.

1239
01:31:40,662 --> 01:31:43,495
Him and this tasty bitch he was with.

1240
01:31:44,916 --> 01:31:47,157
And that's the best part.

1241
01:31:47,836 --> 01:31:50,294
She's fucking this prick, see...

1242
01:31:50,505 --> 01:31:53,588
...this golf pro,
but she's married to some other guy.

1243
01:31:54,175 --> 01:31:56,758
Some hotshot banker.

1244
01:31:58,179 --> 01:32:00,671
And he's the one they pinned it on.

1245
01:32:12,152 --> 01:32:16,020
I have to say that's
the most amazing story I ever heard.

1246
01:32:17,282 --> 01:32:19,774
What amazes me most
is you'd be taken in by it.

1247
01:32:20,535 --> 01:32:21,525
Sir?

1248
01:32:22,454 --> 01:32:27,324
Well, it's obvious this fellow Williams
is impressed with you.

1249
01:32:27,959 --> 01:32:31,873
He hears your tale of woe
and naturally wants to cheer you up.

1250
01:32:32,088 --> 01:32:34,250
He's young, not terribly bright.

1251
01:32:34,799 --> 01:32:38,212
It's not surprising he wouldn't
know what a state he put you in.

1252
01:32:38,636 --> 01:32:40,172
Sir, he's telling the truth.

1253
01:32:40,972 --> 01:32:45,136
Well, let's say for the moment
this Blatch does exist.

1254
01:32:45,393 --> 01:32:50,012
You think he'd just fall to his knees
and cry, "Yes, I did it. I confess.

1255
01:32:50,231 --> 01:32:52,939
Oh, and by the way,
add a life term to my sentence.”

1256
01:32:53,151 --> 01:32:55,939
With Tommy's testimony,
I can get a new trial.

1257
01:32:56,154 --> 01:32:58,612
That's assuming Blatch is even still there.

1258
01:32:58,823 --> 01:33:00,780
Chances are, he'd be released by now.

1259
01:33:00,992 --> 01:33:05,577
They'd have his last known address,
names of relatives. It's a chance, isn't it?

1260
01:33:07,916 --> 01:33:09,657
How can you be so obtuse?

1261
01:33:10,585 --> 01:33:11,825
What?

1262
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:14,544
What did you call me?

1263
01:33:14,756 --> 01:33:16,497
Obtuse. Is it deliberate?

1264
01:33:16,841 --> 01:33:18,331
You're forgetting yourself.

1265
01:33:18,676 --> 01:33:21,634
The country club
will have his old timecards.

1266
01:33:21,846 --> 01:33:24,588
Records, W-2s with his name on them.

1267
01:33:24,808 --> 01:33:27,516
If you want to indulge this fantasy,
it's your business.

1268
01:33:27,685 --> 01:33:30,302
Don't make it mine.
This meeting is over.

1269
01:33:30,522 --> 01:33:33,105
Sir, if I got out, I'd never mention
what happens here.

1270
01:33:33,733 --> 01:33:36,691
I'd be as indictable as you
for laundering that money.

1271
01:33:37,737 --> 01:33:41,526
Don't ever mention money to me again,
you sorry son of a bitch!

1272
01:33:41,699 --> 01:33:43,360
Not in this office...

1273
01:33:43,576 --> 01:33:45,533
...not anywhere. Get in here, now!

1274
01:33:45,745 --> 01:33:48,453
I just wanted to put you at ease,
that's all.

1275
01:33:49,082 --> 01:33:51,198
- Solitary. A month.
- Yes, sir.

1276
01:33:51,376 --> 01:33:54,164
- What's the matter with you?
- Get him out of here.

1277
01:33:54,379 --> 01:33:57,917
This is my chance to get out!
It's my life! Don't you understand?!

1278
01:33:58,133 --> 01:34:00,215
Get him out!

1279
01:34:01,970 --> 01:34:03,927
A month in the hole.

1280
01:34:04,139 --> 01:34:06,847
That's the longest stretch
I ever heard of.

1281
01:34:07,058 --> 01:34:08,344
It's all my fault.

1282
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:10,142
Oh, bullshit.

1283
01:34:10,812 --> 01:34:13,520
You didn't pull the trigger
or convict him.

1284
01:34:13,731 --> 01:34:16,098
Are you saying Andy is innocent?

1285
01:34:16,317 --> 01:34:18,354
I mean, for real innocent?

1286
01:34:18,570 --> 01:34:19,901
It looks that way.

1287
01:34:20,321 --> 01:34:22,232
Sweet Jesus.

1288
01:34:22,490 --> 01:34:24,322
How long has he been here now?

1289
01:34:24,742 --> 01:34:27,985
1947. What is that? Nineteen years.

1290
01:34:28,246 --> 01:34:30,829
- Williams, Thomas.
- Yeah, over here.

1291
01:34:36,671 --> 01:34:37,832
What you got?

1292
01:34:38,464 --> 01:34:39,795
Board of Education.

1293
01:34:40,008 --> 01:34:41,544
That son of a bitch mailed it.

1294
01:34:41,759 --> 01:34:45,718
You going to open it or stand there
with your thumb up your butt?

1295
01:34:45,930 --> 01:34:48,092
Thumb up my butt sounds better.

1296
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:51,433
Hey, Skeet, come on.
Give me that, you shithead.

1297
01:34:52,270 --> 01:34:53,601
Floyd, come on.

1298
01:34:56,191 --> 01:34:57,932
Hey, Red.

1299
01:34:59,027 --> 01:35:01,439
Will you throw that away, please?

1300
01:35:07,035 --> 01:35:08,776
Well, shit.

1301
01:35:21,466 --> 01:35:24,254
The kid passed. C-plus average.

1302
01:35:24,469 --> 01:35:26,551
Thought you'd like to know.

1303
01:35:42,779 --> 01:35:44,235
Warden wants to talk.

1304
01:35:58,002 --> 01:35:59,037
Out here?

1305
01:35:59,254 --> 01:36:01,495
That's what the man said.

1306
01:36:17,605 --> 01:36:21,064
- Warden?
- Tommy?

1307
01:36:26,990 --> 01:36:32,702
Tommy, I'm asking you to keep
this conversation just between us.

1308
01:36:34,205 --> 01:36:36,446
I feel awkward enough as it is.

1309
01:36:54,892 --> 01:36:56,974
We got a situation here.

1310
01:36:57,854 --> 01:36:59,936
I think you can appreciate that.

1311
01:37:00,148 --> 01:37:01,388
Yes, sir.

1312
01:37:01,649 --> 01:37:03,060
I sure can.

1313
01:37:03,318 --> 01:37:07,357
I tell you, son, this thing really
came along and knocked my wind out.

1314
01:37:08,823 --> 01:37:11,406
It's got me up nights. That's the truth.

1315
01:37:13,661 --> 01:37:15,493
The right thing to do...

1316
01:37:17,165 --> 01:37:20,908
...sometimes it's hard to know
what that is.

1317
01:37:21,919 --> 01:37:23,330
Do you understand?

1318
01:37:25,631 --> 01:37:27,247
I need your help, son.

1319
01:37:28,676 --> 01:37:30,838
If I'm going to move on this...

1320
01:37:31,179 --> 01:37:34,342
...there can't be
the least little shred of doubt.

1321
01:37:35,099 --> 01:37:36,134
I have to know...

1322
01:37:36,309 --> 01:37:38,971
...if what you told Dufresne
was the truth.

1323
01:37:39,187 --> 01:37:40,302
Yes, sir.

1324
01:37:40,521 --> 01:37:41,761
Absolutely.

1325
01:37:42,273 --> 01:37:45,265
Would you be willing to swear
before a judge and jury...

1326
01:37:45,443 --> 01:37:47,434
...with your hand on the Good Book...

1327
01:37:47,653 --> 01:37:50,315
...and take an oath
before Almighty God himself?

1328
01:37:50,531 --> 01:37:52,317
Just give me that chance.

1329
01:37:56,621 --> 01:37:57,952
That's what I thought.

1330
01:38:45,002 --> 01:38:46,913
I'm sure by now you've heard.

1331
01:38:48,673 --> 01:38:49,708
Terrible thing.

1332
01:38:51,342 --> 01:38:52,798
A man that young...

1333
01:38:53,136 --> 01:38:55,719
...less than a year to go,
trying to escape.

1334
01:38:56,264 --> 01:38:58,756
Broke Captain Hadley's heart
to shoot him.

1335
01:38:59,517 --> 01:39:01,007
Truly, it did.

1336
01:39:04,021 --> 01:39:06,433
We just have to put it behind us.

1337
01:39:08,109 --> 01:39:09,349
Move on.

1338
01:39:10,945 --> 01:39:12,435
I'm done.

1339
01:39:13,739 --> 01:39:15,355
Everything stops.

1340
01:39:17,368 --> 01:39:19,700
Get someone else to run your scams.

1341
01:39:20,955 --> 01:39:22,787
Nothing stops.

1342
01:39:24,125 --> 01:39:25,490
Nothing.

1343
01:39:28,713 --> 01:39:31,796
Or you will do the hardest time there is.

1344
01:39:32,216 --> 01:39:34,548
No more protection from the guards.

1345
01:39:34,719 --> 01:39:39,634
I'll pull you out of that one-bunk Hilton
and cast you down with the sodomites.

1346
01:39:41,058 --> 01:39:43,470
You'll think you've been
fucked by a train.

1347
01:39:44,896 --> 01:39:46,386
And the library?

1348
01:39:47,064 --> 01:39:48,054
Gone.

1349
01:39:48,649 --> 01:39:51,232
Sealed off, brick by brick.

1350
01:39:51,694 --> 01:39:54,356
We'll have us a little
book barbecue in the yard.

1351
01:39:54,572 --> 01:39:56,688
They'll see the flames for miles.

1352
01:39:56,908 --> 01:39:59,741
We'll dance around it like wild Injuns.

1353
01:40:00,995 --> 01:40:03,987
You understand me? Catching my drift?

1354
01:40:07,752 --> 01:40:09,584
Or am I being obtuse?

1355
01:40:21,390 --> 01:40:24,007
Give him another month
to think about it.

1356
01:41:10,773 --> 01:41:13,811
My wife used to say
I'm a hard man to know.

1357
01:41:14,652 --> 01:41:16,484
Like a closed book.

1358
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:19,317
Complained about it all the time.

1359
01:41:20,241 --> 01:41:21,823
She was beautiful.

1360
01:41:24,203 --> 01:41:26,035
God, I loved her.

1361
01:41:29,458 --> 01:41:31,665
I didn't know how to show it, that's all.

1362
01:41:34,422 --> 01:41:36,083
I killed her, Red.

1363
01:41:37,967 --> 01:41:39,753
I didn't pull the trigger...

1364
01:41:41,178 --> 01:41:42,919
...but I drove her away.

1365
01:41:44,432 --> 01:41:47,140
That's why she died, because of me...

1366
01:41:47,310 --> 01:41:48,675
...the way I am.

1367
01:41:57,695 --> 01:41:59,527
That don't make you a murderer.

1368
01:42:02,908 --> 01:42:04,694
Bad husband, maybe.

1369
01:42:08,331 --> 01:42:11,574
Feel bad about it if you want,
but you didn't pull the trigger.

1370
01:42:11,792 --> 01:42:13,123
No, I didn't.

1371
01:42:13,544 --> 01:42:15,455
Somebody else did.

1372
01:42:16,714 --> 01:42:18,796
And I wound up in here.

1373
01:42:21,260 --> 01:42:22,876
Bad luck, I guess.

1374
01:42:25,765 --> 01:42:29,508
- Yeah.
- It floats around.

1375
01:42:30,561 --> 01:42:32,768
It's got to land on somebody.

1376
01:42:33,689 --> 01:42:35,555
It was my turn, that's all.

1377
01:42:36,275 --> 01:42:39,063
I was in the path of the tornado.

1378
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:48,951
I just didn't expect the storm
would last as long as it has.

1379
01:42:53,292 --> 01:42:54,999
Think you'll ever get out of here?

1380
01:42:56,253 --> 01:42:57,664
Me?

1381
01:43:00,257 --> 01:43:01,588
Yeah.

1382
01:43:02,593 --> 01:43:04,880
One day, when I got
a long, white beard...

1383
01:43:05,096 --> 01:43:09,181
...and two or three marbles rolling
around upstairs, they'll let me out.

1384
01:43:10,267 --> 01:43:11,928
I tell you where I'd go.

1385
01:43:13,396 --> 01:43:15,103
Zihuatanejo.

1386
01:43:15,940 --> 01:43:17,101
Say what?

1387
01:43:17,441 --> 01:43:19,273
Zihuatanejo.

1388
01:43:20,194 --> 01:43:21,855
It's in Mexico.

1389
01:43:23,239 --> 01:43:25,355
A little place on the Pacific Ocean.

1390
01:43:26,492 --> 01:43:29,280
You know what the Mexicans say
about the Pacific?

1391
01:43:29,453 --> 01:43:33,117
- No.
- They say it has no memory.

1392
01:43:35,084 --> 01:43:37,746
That's where I want to live
the rest of my life.

1393
01:43:39,380 --> 01:43:41,872
A warm place with no memory.

1394
01:43:45,136 --> 01:43:47,047
Open up a little hotel...

1395
01:43:48,764 --> 01:43:50,254
...right on the beach.

1396
01:43:50,850 --> 01:43:53,057
Buy some worthless old boat...

1397
01:43:53,602 --> 01:43:55,218
...and fix it up new.

1398
01:43:57,982 --> 01:43:59,188
Take my guests out...

1399
01:44:00,025 --> 01:44:01,390
...Charter fishing.

1400
01:44:05,239 --> 01:44:06,980
Zihuatanejo.

1401
01:44:10,494 --> 01:44:14,362
In a place like that, I could use
a man that knows how to get things.

1402
01:44:20,921 --> 01:44:23,754
I don't think I could make it
on the outside, Andy.

1403
01:44:30,431 --> 01:44:32,513
I been in here most of my life.

1404
01:44:33,934 --> 01:44:35,675
I'm an institutional man now.

1405
01:44:36,604 --> 01:44:38,345
Just like Brooks was.

1406
01:44:38,981 --> 01:44:41,518
Well, you underestimate yourself.

1407
01:44:42,067 --> 01:44:43,683
I don't think so.

1408
01:44:47,531 --> 01:44:51,445
In here I'm the guy who can get things
for you, sure, but...

1409
01:44:52,203 --> 01:44:54,740
...outside all you need
is the Yellow Pages.

1410
01:44:54,955 --> 01:44:57,196
Hell, I wouldn't know
where to begin.

1411
01:44:59,335 --> 01:45:00,951
Pacific Ocean?

1412
01:45:01,378 --> 01:45:02,584
Shit.

1413
01:45:02,963 --> 01:45:05,170
Scare me to death, something that big.

1414
01:45:05,382 --> 01:45:06,668
Not me.

1415
01:45:07,885 --> 01:45:10,627
I didn't shoot my wife,
and I didn't shoot her lover.

1416
01:45:12,389 --> 01:45:15,598
Whatever mistakes I made,
I've paid for them and then some.

1417
01:45:16,644 --> 01:45:18,134
That hotel, that boat...

1418
01:45:19,897 --> 01:45:22,138
I don't think that's too much to ask.

1419
01:45:27,071 --> 01:45:29,483
You shouldn't be doing this to yourself.

1420
01:45:29,698 --> 01:45:31,735
This is just shitty pipe dreams.

1421
01:45:32,159 --> 01:45:34,617
Mexico is way down there
and you're in here...

1422
01:45:34,829 --> 01:45:36,411
...and that's the way it is.

1423
01:45:36,747 --> 01:45:39,580
Yeah, right. That's the way it is.

1424
01:45:41,085 --> 01:45:43,452
It's down there and I'm in here.

1425
01:45:46,048 --> 01:45:48,756
I guess it comes down
to a simple choice.

1426
01:45:51,679 --> 01:45:53,169
Get busy living...

1427
01:45:54,557 --> 01:45:56,594
...or get busy dying.

1428
01:46:00,229 --> 01:46:01,936
Andy.

1429
01:46:05,025 --> 01:46:06,686
Red?

1430
01:46:08,696 --> 01:46:11,438
If you ever get out of here,
do me a favor.

1431
01:46:11,615 --> 01:46:13,902
Sure, Andy. Anything.

1432
01:46:15,786 --> 01:46:19,620
There's a big hayfield up near Buxton.
You know where Buxton is?

1433
01:46:21,125 --> 01:46:24,243
- A lot of hayfields up there.
- One in particular.

1434
01:46:24,461 --> 01:46:28,375
It's got a long rock wall
with a big oak tree at the north end.

1435
01:46:28,591 --> 01:46:31,458
It's like something
out of a Robert Frost poem.

1436
01:46:32,386 --> 01:46:34,878
It's where I asked my wife to marry me.

1437
01:46:36,307 --> 01:46:38,389
We went there for a picnic...

1438
01:46:38,809 --> 01:46:40,891
...and made love under that oak...

1439
01:46:41,562 --> 01:46:43,803
...and I asked and she said yes.

1440
01:46:47,818 --> 01:46:49,650
Promise me, Red.

1441
01:46:50,487 --> 01:46:52,103
If you ever get out...

1442
01:46:52,323 --> 01:46:53,813
...find that spot.

1443
01:46:54,992 --> 01:46:59,828
At the base of that wall, there's a rock
that has no earthly business in Maine.

1444
01:47:00,956 --> 01:47:03,994
Piece of black, volcanic glass.

1445
01:47:06,670 --> 01:47:09,332
Something's buried under it
I want you to have.

1446
01:47:10,090 --> 01:47:11,330
What, Andy?

1447
01:47:11,759 --> 01:47:13,500
What's buried under there?

1448
01:47:15,095 --> 01:47:16,961
You'll have to pry it up...

1449
01:47:17,181 --> 01:47:18,421
...To see.

1450
01:47:24,438 --> 01:47:26,270
No, I'm telling you. The guy is...

1451
01:47:26,941 --> 01:47:28,682
He's talking funny.

1452
01:47:29,777 --> 01:47:31,484
I'm really worried about him.

1453
01:47:31,862 --> 01:47:33,318
Let's keep an eye on him.

1454
01:47:33,530 --> 01:47:36,773
That's fine during the day,
but at night he's all alone.

1455
01:47:38,202 --> 01:47:39,363
Oh, Lord.

1456
01:47:40,704 --> 01:47:42,286
What?

1457
01:47:43,040 --> 01:47:45,782
Andy come down
to the loading dock today.

1458
01:47:46,001 --> 01:47:48,083
He asked me for a length of rope.

1459
01:47:48,295 --> 01:47:51,003
- Rope?
- Six feet long.

1460
01:47:51,215 --> 01:47:52,580
And you gave it to him.

1461
01:47:53,467 --> 01:47:55,253
Sure I did. Why wouldn't I?

1462
01:47:55,469 --> 01:47:57,051
Jesus! Heywood.

1463
01:47:57,638 --> 01:47:59,595
How was I supposed to know?

1464
01:47:59,807 --> 01:48:01,389
Remember Brooks Hatlen?

1465
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:05,309
No. Andy would never do that.

1466
01:48:05,896 --> 01:48:07,352
Never.

1467
01:48:09,066 --> 01:48:10,397
I don't know.

1468
01:48:13,237 --> 01:48:15,228
Every man has his breaking point.

1469
01:48:17,574 --> 01:48:19,861
Lickety-split. Want to get home.

1470
01:48:20,160 --> 01:48:21,901
Just about finished, sir.

1471
01:48:39,054 --> 01:48:40,670
Three deposits tonight.

1472
01:48:48,647 --> 01:48:50,558
Get my stuff down to the laundry.

1473
01:48:50,774 --> 01:48:52,390
And shine my shoes.

1474
01:48:52,609 --> 01:48:55,522
- I want them looking like mirrors.
- Yes, sir.

1475
01:49:01,035 --> 01:49:02,491
It's good having you back, Andy.

1476
01:49:03,454 --> 01:49:05,286
Place wasn't the same without you.

1477
01:49:52,169 --> 01:49:53,534
Lights out!

1478
01:50:26,078 --> 01:50:28,615
I've had some long nights in the stir.

1479
01:50:29,164 --> 01:50:31,826
Alone in the dark
with nothing but your thoughts...

1480
01:50:32,042 --> 01:50:34,704
...time can draw out like a blade.

1481
01:50:40,050 --> 01:50:43,042
That was the longest night of my life.

1482
01:50:58,902 --> 01:51:00,063
Give me a count!

1483
01:51:04,575 --> 01:51:07,408
Tier 3 south, clear!

1484
01:51:10,539 --> 01:51:13,702
Man missing on tier 2, cell 245!

1485
01:51:13,917 --> 01:51:14,952
Dufresne!

1486
01:51:15,502 --> 01:51:17,914
Come out. You're holding up the show!

1487
01:51:21,091 --> 01:51:24,459
Don't make me come down
or I'll thump your skull for you!

1488
01:51:32,060 --> 01:51:35,894
Damn it, you're putting me behind!
I got a schedule to keep.

1489
01:51:36,106 --> 01:51:39,394
You'd better be sick or dead in there.
I shit you not!

1490
01:51:39,610 --> 01:51:40,941
You hear me?

1491
01:51:47,034 --> 01:51:49,116
Oh, my Holy God.

1492
01:52:06,136 --> 01:52:08,673
I want every man
on this cellblock questioned.

1493
01:52:09,139 --> 01:52:11,676
- Start with that friend of his.
- Who?

1494
01:52:11,850 --> 01:52:13,261
Him.

1495
01:52:14,269 --> 01:52:15,805
Open 237.

1496
01:52:19,316 --> 01:52:22,980
What do you mean, "He just wasn't here"?
Don't say that to me.

1497
01:52:23,862 --> 01:52:26,445
- Don't say that to me again.
- But, sir, he wasn't.

1498
01:52:26,657 --> 01:52:30,150
I can see that, Haig! Think I'm blind?

1499
01:52:30,827 --> 01:52:32,409
Is that what you're saying?

1500
01:52:32,579 --> 01:52:35,071
- Am I blind, Haig?
- No, sir!

1501
01:52:35,999 --> 01:52:38,491
What about you. You blind?

1502
01:52:39,002 --> 01:52:41,334
- Tell me what this is.
- Last night's count.

1503
01:52:41,505 --> 01:52:45,043
Uh-huh. You see Dufresne's name there?
I sure do. Right there.

1504
01:52:45,259 --> 01:52:46,590
"Dufresne."

1505
01:52:48,262 --> 01:52:51,004
He was in his cell at lights out.

1506
01:52:51,181 --> 01:52:54,094
Stands to reason he'd still be here
in the morning.

1507
01:52:54,434 --> 01:52:56,050
I want him found.

1508
01:52:56,270 --> 01:52:59,729
Not tomorrow, not after breakfast. Now!

1509
01:52:59,982 --> 01:53:01,188
Yes, sir.

1510
01:53:02,192 --> 01:53:05,981
Let's go. Move your butts. Move it!

1511
01:53:07,864 --> 01:53:08,854
Stand.

1512
01:53:10,284 --> 01:53:11,695
Well?

1513
01:53:14,788 --> 01:53:15,823
Well, what?

1514
01:53:15,998 --> 01:53:19,457
I see you two all the time.
You're thick as thieves, you are.

1515
01:53:20,544 --> 01:53:22,034
He must have said something.

1516
01:53:22,754 --> 01:53:25,667
No, sir, warden. Not a word.

1517
01:53:27,467 --> 01:53:30,050
Lord, it's a miracle!

1518
01:53:30,637 --> 01:53:33,220
Man vanished like a fart in the wind.

1519
01:53:33,890 --> 01:53:35,051
Nothing left...

1520
01:53:35,892 --> 01:53:38,600
...but some damn rocks
on a windowsill.

1521
01:53:38,812 --> 01:53:41,554
And that cupcake on the wall.
Let's ask her.

1522
01:53:41,732 --> 01:53:43,063
Maybe she knows.

1523
01:53:43,233 --> 01:53:46,442
What say there, fuzzy-britches?
Feel like talking?

1524
01:53:46,778 --> 01:53:49,236
Oh, guess not.

1525
01:53:49,781 --> 01:53:51,988
Why should she be any different?

1526
01:53:53,076 --> 01:53:54,737
This is a conspiracy.

1527
01:53:55,370 --> 01:53:57,077
That's what this is.

1528
01:53:57,789 --> 01:54:01,532
One big, damn conspiracy!

1529
01:54:01,793 --> 01:54:03,784
And everyone's in on it!

1530
01:54:04,421 --> 01:54:05,582
Including her!

1531
01:54:40,624 --> 01:54:42,331
In 1966...

1532
01:54:42,542 --> 01:54:44,954
...Andy Dufresne escaped...

1533
01:54:45,128 --> 01:54:46,710
...from Shawshank Prison.

1534
01:54:48,965 --> 01:54:51,502
All they found of him
was a muddy set of prison clothes...

1535
01:54:52,135 --> 01:54:53,671
...a bar of soap...

1536
01:54:53,887 --> 01:54:55,469
...and an old rock hammer...

1537
01:54:55,639 --> 01:54:58,131
...damn near worn down to the nub.

1538
01:55:02,646 --> 01:55:07,391
I remember thinking it would take a man
600 years to tunnel through the wall with it.

1539
01:55:08,026 --> 01:55:10,643
Old Andy did it in less than 20.

1540
01:55:28,964 --> 01:55:31,251
Oh, Andy loved geology.

1541
01:55:32,008 --> 01:55:35,171
I imagine it appealed to
his meticulous nature.

1542
01:55:35,595 --> 01:55:37,427
An ice age here...

1543
01:55:37,848 --> 01:55:40,340
...million years
of mountain-building there.

1544
01:55:41,351 --> 01:55:44,184
Geology is the study
of pressure and time.

1545
01:55:45,021 --> 01:55:47,012
That's all it takes, really.

1546
01:55:47,774 --> 01:55:49,060
Pressure...

1547
01:55:49,526 --> 01:55:51,016
...and time.

1548
01:55:52,112 --> 01:55:54,194
That and a big goddamn poster.

1549
01:55:57,993 --> 01:55:59,154
Like I said...

1550
01:55:59,661 --> 01:56:03,655
...in prison, a man will do anything
to keep his mind occupied.

1551
01:56:06,460 --> 01:56:11,250
Seems Andy's favorite hobby was toting
his wall out into the exercise yard...

1552
01:56:11,798 --> 01:56:13,709
...a handful at a time.

1553
01:56:15,051 --> 01:56:17,088
I guess after Tommy was Killed...

1554
01:56:17,304 --> 01:56:20,262
...Andy decided
he'd been here just about long enough.

1555
01:56:20,474 --> 01:56:23,057
Lickety-split. Want to get home.

1556
01:56:23,768 --> 01:56:25,805
I'm just about finished, sir.

1557
01:56:47,250 --> 01:56:49,207
Three deposits tonight.

1558
01:56:56,510 --> 01:56:58,797
Andy did like he was told.

1559
01:56:59,012 --> 01:57:02,505
Buffed those shoes
to a high mirror-shine.

1560
01:57:06,186 --> 01:57:08,473
The guards simply didn't notice.

1561
01:57:08,772 --> 01:57:10,262
Neither did I.

1562
01:57:10,440 --> 01:57:11,976
I mean, seriously...

1563
01:57:12,192 --> 01:57:15,184
...how often do you really look
at a man's shoes?

1564
01:59:18,735 --> 01:59:21,898
Andy crawled to freedom
through 500 yards...

1565
01:59:22,155 --> 01:59:25,489
...of shit-smelling foulness
I can't even imagine.

1566
01:59:26,493 --> 01:59:28,825
Or maybe I just don't want to.

1567
01:59:33,249 --> 01:59:35,581
Five hundred yards.

1568
01:59:36,086 --> 01:59:39,169
That's the length
of five football fields.

1569
01:59:39,798 --> 01:59:42,381
Just shy of half a mile.

1570
02:00:37,605 --> 02:00:42,190
The next morning, right about the time
Raquel was spilling her little secret...

1571
02:00:42,485 --> 02:00:45,318
...a man nobody ever
laid eyes on before...

1572
02:00:45,572 --> 02:00:48,155
...strolled into
the Maine National Bank.

1573
02:00:48,742 --> 02:00:51,905
Until that moment, he didn't exist.

1574
02:00:52,495 --> 02:00:54,827
- Except on paper.
- May I help you?

1575
02:00:55,248 --> 02:00:57,159
He had all the proper ID--

1576
02:00:57,375 --> 02:01:01,084
Driver's license, birth certificate,
Social Security card.

1577
02:01:01,504 --> 02:01:04,041
--And the signature
was a spot-on match.

1578
02:01:04,257 --> 02:01:07,340
I must say I'm sorry
to be losing your business.

1579
02:01:07,552 --> 02:01:09,293
I hope you'll enjoy living abroad.

1580
02:01:10,096 --> 02:01:11,678
Thank you.

1581
02:01:11,848 --> 02:01:13,009
I'm sure I will.

1582
02:01:13,933 --> 02:01:17,267
Here's your cashier's check, sir.
Will there be anything else?

1583
02:01:17,479 --> 02:01:18,469
Please.

1584
02:01:19,022 --> 02:01:21,514
Would you add this
to your outgoing mail?

1585
02:01:22,025 --> 02:01:23,561
I'd be happy to.

1586
02:01:25,028 --> 02:01:26,359
Good day, sir.

1587
02:01:27,322 --> 02:01:31,737
Mr. Stevens visited nearly
a dozen banks in the Portland area.

1588
02:01:32,202 --> 02:01:33,818
All told, he blew town...

1589
02:01:34,037 --> 02:01:38,873
...with better than $370,000
of Warden Norton's money.

1590
02:01:39,542 --> 02:01:42,330
Severance pay for 19 years.

1591
02:01:49,552 --> 02:01:51,759
Good morning, Portland Daily Bugle.

1592
02:02:44,607 --> 02:02:47,565
Byron Hadley?
You have the right to remain silent.

1593
02:02:47,819 --> 02:02:52,279
If you give up this right, anything you
say can be held against you in court.

1594
02:02:52,699 --> 02:02:57,159
I wasn't there to see it, but I hear
Byron Hadley sobbed like a little girl...

1595
02:02:57,370 --> 02:02:58,860
...when they took him away.

1596
02:03:04,752 --> 02:03:08,120
Norton had no intention
of going that quietly.

1597
02:03:24,105 --> 02:03:25,470
Samuel Norton.

1598
02:03:25,648 --> 02:03:27,639
We have a warrant for your arrest.
Open up.

1599
02:03:31,279 --> 02:03:34,271
Norton. Open the door.

1600
02:03:34,449 --> 02:03:35,689
I'm not sure which key.

1601
02:03:38,494 --> 02:03:40,405
Norton!

1602
02:03:45,835 --> 02:03:47,792
Make it easy on yourself, Norton!

1603
02:03:59,307 --> 02:04:02,766
I like to think the last thing
that went through his head...

1604
02:04:02,977 --> 02:04:04,559
...other than that bullet...

1605
02:04:04,771 --> 02:04:09,186
...was to wonder how the hell
Andy Dufresne ever got the best of him.

1606
02:04:11,694 --> 02:04:15,187
Not long after the warden
deprived us of his company...

1607
02:04:15,448 --> 02:04:17,530
<i>...1 got a postcard in the mail.</i>

1608
02:04:18,993 --> 02:04:21,826
It was blank, but the postmark said...

1609
02:04:22,038 --> 02:04:24,154
...Fort Hancock, Texas.

1610
02:04:24,707 --> 02:04:26,038
Fort Hancock...

1611
02:04:26,334 --> 02:04:28,041
...right on the border.

1612
02:04:28,461 --> 02:04:30,452
That's where Andy crossed.

1613
02:04:31,047 --> 02:04:35,166
When I picture him heading south
in his own car with the top down...

1614
02:04:35,510 --> 02:04:37,717
...It always makes me laugh.

1615
02:04:39,555 --> 02:04:41,137
Andy Dufresne...

1616
02:04:41,516 --> 02:04:43,553
...who crawled through
a river of shit...

1617
02:04:43,726 --> 02:04:46,138
...and came out clean
on the other side.

1618
02:04:46,980 --> 02:04:48,345
Andy Dufresne...

1619
02:04:49,148 --> 02:04:50,730
...headed for the Pacific.

1620
02:04:53,736 --> 02:04:55,898
Hadley's got him
by the throat, right?

1621
02:04:56,072 --> 02:04:59,906
He says, "I believe this boy's
about to have himself an accident.”

1622
02:05:00,076 --> 02:05:02,943
Those of us who knew him best
talk about him often.

1623
02:05:03,621 --> 02:05:05,328
I swear, the stuff he pulled...

1624
02:05:05,540 --> 02:05:08,498
"My friends could use
a couple of beers."

1625
02:05:08,835 --> 02:05:10,496
And he got it!

1626
02:05:11,754 --> 02:05:14,121
Sometimes it makes me sad, though...

1627
02:05:14,424 --> 02:05:15,835
...Andy being gone.

1628
02:05:16,551 --> 02:05:20,670
I have to remind myself that
some birds aren't meant to be caged.

1629
02:05:21,139 --> 02:05:23,221
Their feathers are just too bright.

1630
02:05:24,934 --> 02:05:26,641
And when they fly away...

1631
02:05:27,103 --> 02:05:31,472
...the part of you that knows it was
a sin to lock them up does rejoice.

1632
02:05:32,567 --> 02:05:33,807
But still...

1633
02:05:34,277 --> 02:05:38,612
...the place you live in is that much
more drab and empty that they're gone.

1634
02:05:42,827 --> 02:05:45,194
I guess I just miss my friend.

1635
02:06:09,645 --> 02:06:10,806
Please sit down.

1636
02:06:16,652 --> 02:06:18,234
Ellis Boyd Redding...

1637
02:06:18,780 --> 02:06:22,023
...your files say you've served
40 years of a life sentence.

1638
02:06:22,825 --> 02:06:24,987
You feel you've been rehabilitated?

1639
02:06:26,829 --> 02:06:28,411
Rehabilitated?

1640
02:06:30,458 --> 02:06:32,324
Well, now, let me see.

1641
02:06:33,336 --> 02:06:35,668
I don't have any idea what that means.

1642
02:06:37,799 --> 02:06:40,040
It means you're ready
to rejoin society--

1643
02:06:40,635 --> 02:06:42,967
I know what you think it means, sonny.

1644
02:06:45,139 --> 02:06:47,130
To me it's just a made-up word.

1645
02:06:48,476 --> 02:06:50,808
A politician's word so that...

1646
02:06:51,229 --> 02:06:54,767
...young fellas like yourself
can wear a suit and a tie...

1647
02:06:55,233 --> 02:06:56,849
...and have a job.

1648
02:06:58,820 --> 02:07:00,902
What do you really want to know?

1649
02:07:01,697 --> 02:07:03,654
Am I sorry for what I did?

1650
02:07:04,075 --> 02:07:05,361
Well, are you?

1651
02:07:07,161 --> 02:07:09,994
There's not a day goes by
I don't feel regret.

1652
02:07:11,374 --> 02:07:14,833
Not because I'm in here
or because you think I should.

1653
02:07:18,297 --> 02:07:20,880
I look back on the way I was then...

1654
02:07:23,010 --> 02:07:24,341
...a young...

1655
02:07:25,263 --> 02:07:28,756
...stupid kid who committed
that terrible crime.

1656
02:07:31,769 --> 02:07:33,476
I want to talk to him.

1657
02:07:35,398 --> 02:07:37,890
I want to try
and talk some sense to him.

1658
02:07:38,609 --> 02:07:40,566
Tell him the way things are.

1659
02:07:42,655 --> 02:07:44,066
But I can't.

1660
02:07:46,284 --> 02:07:48,275
That kid's long gone...

1661
02:07:49,495 --> 02:07:52,237
...and this old man is all that's left.

1662
02:07:53,666 --> 02:07:55,122
I got to live with that.

1663
02:07:56,502 --> 02:07:58,209
Rehabilitated?

1664
02:07:58,588 --> 02:08:00,420
It's just a bullshit word.

1665
02:08:01,340 --> 02:08:06,085
So you go on and stamp your forms,
sonny, and stop wasting my time.

1666
02:08:07,346 --> 02:08:09,587
Because to tell you the truth...

1667
02:08:09,932 --> 02:08:11,923
...don't give a shit.

1668
02:09:38,479 --> 02:09:39,844
Here you go, miss.

1669
02:09:42,817 --> 02:09:43,852
Restroom break, boss?

1670
02:09:49,657 --> 02:09:54,197
You don't need to ask me every time you
need to go take a piss. Just go. Understand?

1671
02:09:55,204 --> 02:09:56,820
Yes, sir.

1672
02:10:07,216 --> 02:10:10,299
Forty years I've been asking
permission to piss.

1673
02:10:11,137 --> 02:10:14,129
I can't squeeze a drop without say-so.

1674
02:10:17,643 --> 02:10:19,805
There's a harsh truth to face.

1675
02:10:21,480 --> 02:10:24,393
No way I'm going to make it
on the outside.

1676
02:10:32,241 --> 02:10:35,950
All I do anymore is think of ways
to break my parole...

1677
02:10:36,746 --> 02:10:39,238
...So maybe they'd send me back.

1678
02:10:44,420 --> 02:10:46,878
Terrible thing, to live in fear.

1679
02:10:47,757 --> 02:10:49,418
Brooks Hatlen knew it.

1680
02:10:49,633 --> 02:10:51,590
Knew it all too well.

1681
02:10:53,179 --> 02:10:56,592
All I want is to be back
where things make sense.

1682
02:10:57,016 --> 02:10:59,758
Where I won't have to be afraid
all the time.

1683
02:11:01,771 --> 02:11:04,103
Only one thing stops me.

1684
02:11:05,566 --> 02:11:07,933
A promise I made to Andy.

1685
02:11:28,464 --> 02:11:29,795
There it is.

1686
02:11:40,226 --> 02:11:41,887
Much obliged, sir.

1687
02:15:21,196 --> 02:15:22,482
Dear Red:

1688
02:15:22,698 --> 02:15:25,190
If you're reading this,
you've gotten out...

1689
02:15:25,367 --> 02:15:29,531
...and if you've come this far,
maybe you're willing to come a little further.

1690
02:15:29,705 --> 02:15:32,197
You remember the name
of the town, don't you?

1691
02:15:34,501 --> 02:15:35,991
Zihuatanejo.

1692
02:15:37,630 --> 02:15:41,214
I could use a good man
to help me get my project on wheels.

1693
02:15:41,717 --> 02:15:45,255
I'll keep an eye out for you,
and the chessboard ready.

1694
02:15:46,055 --> 02:15:47,466
Remember, Red...

1695
02:15:47,806 --> 02:15:49,888
...hope is a good thing...

1696
02:15:50,100 --> 02:15:52,091
...maybe the best of things.

1697
02:15:52,311 --> 02:15:54,473
And no good thing ever dies.

1698
02:15:55,022 --> 02:15:57,889
I will be hoping
that this letter finds you...

1699
02:15:58,067 --> 02:15:59,808
...and finds you well.

1700
02:16:00,319 --> 02:16:01,559
Your friend...

1701
02:16:01,737 --> 02:16:02,898
...Andy.

1702
02:16:36,772 --> 02:16:38,479
"Get busy living...

1703
02:16:38,691 --> 02:16:40,602
...or get busy dying."

1704
02:16:43,278 --> 02:16:45,440
That's goddamn right.

1705
02:16:50,703 --> 02:16:52,819
For the second time in my life...

1706
02:16:53,080 --> 02:16:55,617
...I'm guilty of committing a crime.

1707
02:16:56,709 --> 02:16:58,620
Parole violation.

1708
02:16:59,294 --> 02:17:02,958
Of course, I doubt they'll toss up
any roadblocks for that.

1709
02:17:03,632 --> 02:17:05,669
Not for an old crook like me.

1710
02:17:05,884 --> 02:17:07,921
Fort Hancock, Texas, please.

1711
02:17:11,598 --> 02:17:16,308
I find I'm so excited I can barely
sit still or hold a thought in my head.

1712
02:17:16,770 --> 02:17:20,104
I think it's the excitement
only a free man can feel.

1713
02:17:20,315 --> 02:17:22,807
A free man at the start
of a long journey...

1714
02:17:22,985 --> 02:17:25,602
...whose conclusion is uncertain.

1715
02:17:28,615 --> 02:17:31,277
I hope I can make it across the border.

1716
02:17:32,786 --> 02:17:35,824
I hope to see my friend
and shake his hand.

1717
02:17:37,666 --> 02:17:41,751
I hope the Pacific is as blue
as it has been in my dreams.

1718
02:17:43,589 --> 02:17:44,795
I hope.
